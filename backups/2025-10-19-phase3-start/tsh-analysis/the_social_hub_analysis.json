Pretentious under qualified staff, specially the ones managing the memberships! Kids, I'm guessing hired to make the place look hip but clueless about making a visit convert to business. No wonder all events r a fail here and the place has not picked up in its first yr. The place is strictly a hotel. Living in this space serves no benefit. It's incredibly expensive for facilities it cannot offer, The gym is way too small and always packed. The laundry room? For 1600€ a month u better have a laundry machine! The pools r not nice and awkward to swim when even few ppl r sitting around it. Most hotel guests r 50+ even tho Social Hub tries to be hip. The little cafe has random strict rules, unless u work or hotel guest u can only have to-go coffee apparently. Random new rule this week! The other doesn't allow laptops but it's always empty.

It’s definitely not worth the price. especially with their dynamic pricing. You could end up paying close to 200 euros a night for a basic single room. which is high.\n\nThe AC wasn’t strong enough for a hot day and the windows barely open, which made it worse.\n\nThe gym was nice, but the restaurants and coffee shop were overpriced for very average quality.

My room was clean, comfortable, and well maintained, with a Nespresso machine for coffee. As a nice touch, I even received a welcome package with cookies.\n\nThe vibe of the hotel is young and lively, with lots of people around, and the breakfast is definitely worth it. Small things to note: slippers are not provided unless you ask, and I would have appreciated having water in the room — instead I had to buy a bottle downstairs for €3.50.\n\nOverall, it’s a modern, welcoming place with good energy, and I’d recommend it both for business and leisure stays.",

The downsides were more in design of the room, no counter space in the bathroom and only one luggage stand. The biggest downer for me was the shower.

They’ll make reservations for you, answer any questions, and really try to accommodate whatever you need.\n\nWhen you first arrive, the check-in process can feel a little off-putting if you’re not younger or tech-savvy, since there isn’t a traditional reception desk. Instead, there’s a round desk and self-check-in computers. That said, the staff are very attentive — if they see you having trouble, they’ll happily step in and handle it for you.\n\nThe common areas are beautiful. The coffee bar is great, the restaurant and bar staff are welcoming, and the pool bar has a nice setup with friendly service.\n\nAs for the rooms: they are small, and the price-to-quality ratio isn’t the best given the size. Storage is limited — no drawers, just a rack with hangers and a few shelves. The bathroom is also tight, so I’d recommend bringing a hanging toiletry bag to make it easier. On the plus side, the rooms come with a fridge, a safe, and a smart TV (great for streaming), and the air conditioning worked perfectly. We also had a nice view.\n\nAnother big plus is the included laundry service, which works through their app — I recommend downloading it when you arrive.\n\nOverall, while the rooms are on the smaller side, what truly makes The Social Hub stand out is the people who work there. They are what make the experience special.",

        "text": "I’m changing my previous review towards 2 stars based on my recent super disappointing experience. I’ve stayed at this hotel many times and recommended it to many. This week I booked 2 stays, one in their new type room which was fine, the other in one of their older single rooms. The new room type doesn’t solve the issue that the rooms are noisy (you hear anyone who comes in and out of their own rooms) but the design is cute. Unfortunately my second stay had very dirty shower and toilet. I noticed it on the morning of my check out and mentioned it at the reception. Despite showing them how disgusting it was and explaining how gross it felt, their reaction was that they agreed it’s not right and will inform house cleaning. Clearly the issue isn’t only linked to a cleaner forgetting one time something (the dirt is well accumulated) but also how the reception staff is trained when facing such issues. At 200 euros per night this really isn’t acceptable for such issue to be taken lightly. Highly unprofessional and disappointing!",

        "text": "A student hotel, located near the centre of The Hague. From the beginning, it looked good, however, after staying here for a year I can definitely say that:\n1) Area is totally unsafe: robberies are not uncommon here. And be aware that staff won't help you in a dangerous situation, even on a territory of hotel, because they can't even protect themselves lol.\n2) Cleaning is one of the worst things here, they can ignore cleaning of your room for a months, so you have to come to the reception many times and ask to finally clean your room.\n3) Rude and useless staff (especially at the reception, as I already said)\n4) The price is too high for the absolute disregard for students that we end up with.\n5) Not only is the price high, but they also regularly fill the budget with fines for ridiculous reasons, or even without them (a few days ago, for example, they gave a fine 150 euros for a guy who shouted once in honor of successful end of the exam). 150 euros btw is a minimum fine here, so for every little thing you will pay exactly this amount.\n6) Rooms are small, many problems with bathroom. Alarm system can start to scream with no reason.\n7) They delete negative reviews, and it is already confirmed because they already deleted my negative comment at the beginning of the academic year when I faced troubles with cleaning.\n8) Very loud, for someone it is okay, but for guests who want quiet and cosy place - pick something else.\n9) One more thing about safety: if some guys will come and steal something from you, then the SH administration will say that they can't help you, that the cameras didn't record anything, or that they don't even have recordings as it was at first time.\n\nInteresting situation to conclude: We (students who live in the hotel) played table tennis late in the evening (it is not forbidden by the rules), and there were also 2 guests from the hotel (not students, but who came for a couple of nights). Everything was normal until an aggressive security guard came and rudely said that we can't play table tennis here anymore, so he took our rackets and told us to go to our rooms. But when we asked why he didn't care about hotel guests who also played (they started to play table tennis after security kicked us) he said that they are hotel guests and they can do everything. So the attitude towards students is simply disgusting as you can see. Not even gonna talk about winter rules when they literally made a prison instead of a hotel for students.\nOverall, this happens because they clearly understand that situation with housing in this country is really difficult, so they increase the price of living yearly (or even more often).\nBye-bye and never again!!",

        "text": "This is my second stay as a long-term stay resident.\nLet me tell you this.\nFirstly, the hotel's facilities are generally alright and have been consistently okay throughout the three years that I have been living in this country. It is nothing too stellar, but they do provide nice house cleanings and kitchen cleanings. However, the quality of the service remained the same, while the price of the long-term stay have noticeably increased. Now every contract price is around 200-300 euros more for the same living facilities.\nSecondly, the management's decision-making and attitude towards the residents has 100% gotten worse. The big door broke and does not close? Let's put a big chunk of wood blocking the entrance that is extremely inconvenient in emergency situation (guess what, a medical emergency DID HAPPEN, so they had to remove it and decided it to reinstall it right after, genius move)\nOh, there are SOME students that are loud in the smoking area? Let's restrict the smoking area after 10 pm and force students out of the perfectly safe space onto the street, where they are JUST AS LOUD, but where random people can pick a fight with them (had happened, and more than once). Genius idea👍, love collective punishment in a place im paying 1.2k for.\nThirdly, the location. Generally speaking, the location is alright. But during the year, we have had random people barging in, playing with gym equipment, jumping over the gate and provoking the students. One of the times a guy threatened a friend of mine with a gun, another time a random hobo was threatening me through a window. By far, the worst aspect of this place is the amount of freaks that I encounter unwillingly on a semi-regular basis WITHIN the bounds of the hotel.\nWould not recommend for more than one stay.",

        "text": "I stayed here for a few months as a student in 2022. Honestly, I expected a lot more, especially for the price. It might be fine for a few nights as a tourist, but for students staying longer, it’s really not worth it.\n\nLet’s start with the positives:\nThe shared kitchen gets cleaned twice a week, which helps a lot. Laundry is free to use, which is nice — but there are only three washing machines and three dryers for the whole building, so it’s often a struggle to find one available. The staff are friendly and polite, and they do try to help when you ask.\n\nBut here’s what was frustrating:\nThere are no clear kitchen rules, so everyone just does whatever they want. It gets messy quickly, and not everyone respects shared spaces.\nMaintenance is very slow. My bathroom was clogged from the first day, and it took almost a week (and several reminders) before it was fixed. The shared kitchen had broken appliances (fridge, light, vent, dishwasher) for weeks, even though we were told someone would take care of it — nothing happened for a long time.\nThe kitchen is also too small for the number of people sharing it, which makes cooking stressful.\n\nMy room was spacious but quite dark because there wasn’t enough lighting. The walls are thin, so you can hear almost everything happening in the hallway or outside. The mattress was uncomfortable and uneven, and even after reporting it multiple times, nothing changed. The shower is very small, and the thin curtain causes water to spill everywhere.\n\nThere’s no door lock inside the rooms — which made me feel unsafe, especially as a solo female student.\n\nThe gym was another disappointment. It looks nice online, but it’s missing basic equipment like a squat rack and a leg press. There are only two benches and one mirror, which really isn’t enough for such a big place.\n\nI chose this place because I wanted a comfortable, hassle-free stay, even if it cost more (around €1,200/month). But in reality, it just didn’t live up to what was promised. For long-term students, I honestly think DUWO housing is much more worth it (around €600–700/month) — if you’re lucky enough to get a spot.",

But otherwise it feels more like a social space first and a hotel second.\n\nThe staff don’t seem very experienced, and the rooms themselves feel like a lot of corners were cut. It’s definitely not worth the price. especially with their dynamic pricing. You could end up paying close to 200 euros a night for a basic single room. which is high.\n\nThe AC wasn’t strong enough for a hot day and the windows barely open, which made it worse.\n\nThe gym was nice, but the restaurants and coffee shop were overpriced for very average quality. I was also expecting better bikes, but they only had single-gear ones that are tough to ride and usually booked out.\n\nGood location but Overall just not worth the price.",

Told staff about a maintenance problem in my room, was told ‘tough, it’ll be dealt with after you’ve left’, had no less than 3 fire alarms over a weekend, and the room layout was clearly designed by someone who never stays in hotels! No table by the bed, no power sockets handy and light only controllable by the main door - super handy for those 2am fire alarms!\n\nThis is absolutely NOT a 4* hotel. It’s possibly an expensive 4* HOSTEL at best, which, if that’s what you’re after, it’s probably a good choice. Otherwise, avoid.",

This week I booked 2 stays, one in their new type room which was fine, the other in one of their older single rooms. The new room type doesn’t solve the issue that the rooms are noisy (you hear anyone who comes in and out of their own rooms) but the design is cute. Unfortunately my second stay had very dirty shower and toilet. I noticed it on the morning of my check out and mentioned it at the reception. Despite showing them how disgusting it was and explaining how gross it felt, their reaction was that they agreed it’s not right and will inform house cleaning. Clearly the issue isn’t only linked to a cleaner forgetting one time something (the dirt is well accumulated) but also how the reception staff is trained when facing such issues. At 200 euros per night this really isn’t acceptable for such issue to be taken lightly. Highly unprofessional and disappointing!",

It might be fine for a few nights as a tourist, but for students staying longer, it’s really not worth it.\n\nLet’s start with the positives:\nThe shared kitchen gets cleaned twice a week, which helps a lot. Laundry is free to use, which is nice — but there are only three washing machines and three dryers for the whole building, so it’s often a struggle to find one available. The staff are friendly and polite, and they do try to help when you ask.\n\nBut here’s what was frustrating:\nThere are no clear kitchen rules, so everyone just does whatever they want. It gets messy quickly, and not everyone respects shared spaces.\nMaintenance is very slow. My bathroom was clogged from the first day, and it took almost a week (and several reminders) before it was fixed. The shared kitchen had broken appliances (fridge, light, vent, dishwasher) for weeks, even though we were told someone would take care of it — nothing happened for a long time.\nThe kitchen is also too small for the number of people sharing it, which makes cooking stressful.\n\nMy room was spacious but quite dark because there wasn’t enough lighting. The walls are thin, so you can hear almost everything happening in the hallway or outside. The mattress was uncomfortable and uneven, and even after reporting it multiple times, nothing changed. The shower is very small, and the thin curtain causes water to spill everywhere.\n\nThere’s no door lock inside the rooms — which made me feel unsafe, especially as a solo female student.\n\nThe gym was another disappointment. It looks nice online, but it’s missing basic equipment like a squat rack and a leg press. There are only two benches and one mirror, which really isn’t enough for such a big place.\n\nI chose this place because I wanted a comfortable, hassle-free stay, even if it cost more (around €1,200/month). But in reality, it just didn’t live up to what was promised. For long-term students, I honestly think DUWO housing is much more worth it (around €600–700/month) — if you’re lucky enough to get a spot.",
