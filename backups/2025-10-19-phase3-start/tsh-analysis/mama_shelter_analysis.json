First, I was surprised to find no slippers in the room, which is typically a standard offering at most hotels. When I asked about it, the response was ‚Äúplease buy it,‚Äù which felt a bit off for a hotel of this caliber.\n\nThe room itself was clean and well-maintained, which I appreciated. However, I would have liked to see complimentary bottled water in the room, as well as a liquid soap dispenser rather than the solid soap provided (including shampoo). It was a bit inconvenient for showering.\n\nOn a positive note, the breakfast was fantastic! It was definitely the highlight of my stay ‚Äì great selection, fresh, and tasty.\n\nOverall, while the breakfast was excellent and the room was nice, I think Mama Shelter Luxembourg could improve in terms of amenities and customer service for a more complete guest experience.",

One of the highlights is definitely the rooftop bar, which has an amazing view over Lisbon and a great atmosphere, especially in the evenings.||The rooms aren‚Äôt huge, but they‚Äôre comfortable and well-designed, with everything you need for a short stay. The restaurant and overall design of the space are trendy and vibrant, though we didn‚Äôt get a chance to try the food.||It‚Äôs worth noting that the vibe leans more toward a younger crowd‚Äîlively, modern, and social‚Äîso if that‚Äôs your scene, you‚Äôll feel right at home. Overall, a great choice for a stylish and central Lisbon stay.",

There were flies in the room even though I didn‚Äôt open the window. The last day I saw a bug in the toilet. The toilet paper holder was loose. I went to the rooftop and ordered Roast-beef but they didn‚Äôt tell me there are 2; one with the hash-brown  and tomatoes and the other one is simple. So they brought the expensive one which was 10 Euro more. Also they charge you extra during the check in and they deduct from this amount when you consume food and drinks that was a bit confusing and unnecessary makes it hard to track. The rooftop was nice. The food was good at the restaurant. Breakfast was also good I had 2 times.",

It smells of cold, and water was leaking form the roof at several areas in the bar. Once, a drop from the roof, went directly into my wine. I left at that point. The air is overly humid due to poor drainage from the roof, which is slatted and opens. It probably needs maintenance. I notice both bartenders had a wet cough, indicating the air quality is unhealthy. If the smell of wet towels in the back of a car on a hot summer day, did not give the problem away. I feel the employees are used to the smell, but several people commented on the same.\n\nP.S. If you want evidence of the water drainage problems. Look at the security camera overlooking the bar. It is covered in red algae, and has water directly flowing over it to the bar floor.\n\nBest regards,",

No coffee / kettle in the room. (Tip: Buy a big bottle from the supermarket and put it in the fridge).\n\nBreakfast is a bit disappointing for the price. (Tip: Go to one of the cafes nearby instead).\n\nThe bar can be very loud and getting served takes a while, but the decor and surroundings is very nice.\n\nBoth times the roof terrace has been closed.\n\nThe staff is always very good. Always nice to see the same, friendly faces.\n\nHaving stayed in a few other Lisbon hotels, I would take Mama Shelter but it's not the Mama experience of other cities.",

Leider muss ich zugeben, dass wir heute erst um 14.30 Uhr reserviert hatten. Und als wir kamen, war das Essen, die warmen Speisen, halt auch nicht mehr so warm. Die Schilder wurden teilweise schon abger√§umt, sodass man nicht mehr genau wusste, was im Essen war. Es gibt auch gar keine Allergene, die angezeigt wurden. Man muss alles extra jeweils immer nachfragen und sogar da war die Servicekraft sich nicht sicher. F√ºr mich gab es nicht mal was Vegetarisches mehr, au√üer verschiedene kalte Speisen. Es wurde auch keine neue Pizza mehr gemacht. Als wir ankamen, lag da anderthalb Pizza mit Speck. Bis um 16.00 Uhr wurde da nichts erneuert. Was sehr schade war, weil ich finde, wenn man bis 16.00 Uhr Brunch anbietet, muss man halt auch garantieren, dass die Leute immer noch f√ºr den gleichen Preis auch das gleiche Essen bekommen als eine Stunde davor. Oder man muss halt dann auch mit dem Preis runtergehen, wenn man dann schon abbauen m√∂chte und kein neues Essen zubereiten m√∂chte. Was ich sehr schade fand und auch viel zu teuer f√ºr 53 Euro, halt mit der Auswahl, die wir als Vegetarier hatten.",

Vamos l√° aos factos‚Ä¶\n\nEra o anivers√°rio da minha namorada, o que supostamente era para ser uma comemora√ß√£o feliz e incr√≠vel com os nossos amigos. Ela havia escolhido o lugar pois ela j√° conhecia o Mama Shelter de outros s√≠tios e, por gostar da vibe, imaginou que seria a mesma coisa aqui em Lisboa.\n\nO respons√°vel pela loja naquela noite era o F√°bio, que fez um comunicado desagrad√°vel e tendenciosamente arrogante ao meio da mesa, enquanto alguns dos nossos amigos estavam a fazer as suas refei√ß√µes e a tomar os seus drinks, com o foco numa mensagem do tipo:\n‚ÄúPara mantermos a mesa aqui, todos t√™m que consumir no m√≠nimo 28‚Ç¨. Se todos n√£o forem comer, acaba por n√£o compensar‚Äù, e coisas do g√©nero‚Ä¶\n\nComo podem imaginar, por si s√≥ j√° foi extremamente desconfort√°vel e frustrante, porque uma coisa √© certa: n√£o √©ramos todos que √≠amos comer ali, e visto que cada drink ali ronda os 15‚Ç¨ em m√©dia, n√£o h√° d√∫vida de que a mesa ultrapassaria facilmente o valor de consumo por pessoa.\nO que claramente n√£o foi feito devido a este aviso desconfort√°vel e √† falta de prepara√ß√£o tanto do Mama Shelter como estabelecimento, quanto dos seus funcion√°rios. Claramente o F√°bio deve ter feito o que lhe foi instru√≠do, por√©m essa est√° longe de ser a forma correcta de lidar com o cliente final.\n\nEu e mais dois amigos fomos ter com ele, longe da mesa e dos restantes convidados, a fim de resolver a situa√ß√£o. No final, ficou resolvida, n√£o tivemos de sair, mas certamente fez com que a nossa noite ficasse ali, estragada e manchada por ele.\n\nPretendo n√£o voltar a este restaurante nunca mais, e recomendo que, antes de fecharem qualquer coisa a n√≠vel digital, liguem e esclare√ßam todas as d√∫vidas, porque em nenhum momento, at√© ao aviso desagrad√°vel do F√°bio, foi-nos informado que cada pessoa teria de consumir pelo menos 28‚Ç¨ ‚Äî o que, ali√°s, n√£o seria problema para nenhum de n√≥s.\n\nA √∫nica coisa que tive de deixar inicialmente ‚Äî e que foi muito bem avisada ‚Äî foi colocar os dados do cart√£o de cr√©dito para assegurar 120‚Ç¨, caso n√£o desmarcasse a tempo, o que √© totalmente justo.\n\nSobre o estabelecimento: √© muito barulhento, mesas demasiado pr√≥ximas, climatiza√ß√£o aqu√©m, atendimento p√©ssimo, decora√ß√£o razo√°vel ‚Äî uma experi√™ncia digna de 1ou 2 estrela no m√°ximo.\n\nSe quiserem experimentar, n√£o recomendo. Mas tirem as vossas pr√≥prias conclus√µes.\n\n√Ä equipa do Mama Shelter.",
