It was not a warm and friendly environment. the spot i was allocated too was uncomfortable because of the cooling system, even in the workout rooms the AC is uncomfortable, the water makes noise, yesterday the toilet was out of order, its a general mess!

No wonder all events r a fail here and the place has not picked up in its first yr. The place is strictly a hotel. Living in this space serves no benefit. It's incredibly expensive for facilities it cannot offer, The gym is way too small and always packed. The laundry room? For 1600€ a month u better have a laundry machine! The pools r not nice and awkward to swim when even few ppl r sitting around it. Most hotel guests r 50+ even tho Social Hub tries to be hip. The little cafe has random strict rules, unless u work or hotel guest u can only have to-go coffee apparently. Random new rule this week! The other doesn't allow laptops but it's always empty. Expensive coffee too. The management does not read the room of what Porto is and wants.",

It’s definitely not worth the price. especially with their dynamic pricing. You could end up paying close to 200 euros a night for a basic single room. which is high.\n\nThe AC wasn’t strong enough for a hot day and the windows barely open, which made it worse.\n\nThe gym was nice, but the restaurants and coffee shop were overpriced for very average quality.

The downsides were more in design of the room, no counter space in the bathroom and only one luggage stand. The biggest downer for me was the shower. It didn't get very hot and it kept cycling a burst of cold water every 30 seconds or so. This was the only thing that would really make me not choose this hotel again.",

They’ll make reservations for you, answer any questions, and really try to accommodate whatever you need.\n\nWhen you first arrive, the check-in process can feel a little off-putting if you’re not younger or tech-savvy, since there isn’t a traditional reception desk. Instead, there’s a round desk and self-check-in computers. That said, the staff are very attentive — if they see you having trouble, they’ll happily step in and handle it for you.\n\nThe common areas are beautiful. The coffee bar is great, the restaurant and bar staff are welcoming, and the pool bar has a nice setup with friendly service.\n\nAs for the rooms: they are small, and the price-to-quality ratio isn’t the best given the size. Storage is limited — no drawers, just a rack with hangers and a few shelves. The bathroom is also tight, so I’d recommend bringing a hanging toiletry bag to make it easier. On the plus side, the rooms come with a fridge, a safe, and a smart TV (great for streaming), and the air conditioning worked perfectly. We also had a nice view.\n\nAnother big plus is the included laundry service, which works through their app — I recommend downloading it when you arrive.\n\nOverall, while the rooms are on the smaller side, what truly makes The Social Hub stand out is the people who work there. They are what make the experience special.",

The staff are friendly and always available if you need help, even though check-in and check-out are mostly self-service. My room was clean, comfortable, and well maintained, with a Nespresso machine for coffee. As a nice touch, I even received a welcome package with cookies.\n\nThe vibe of the hotel is young and lively, with lots of people around, and the breakfast is definitely worth it. Small things to note: slippers are not provided unless you ask, and I would have appreciated having water in the room — instead I had to buy a bottle downstairs for €3.50.\n\nOverall, it’s a modern, welcoming place with good energy, and I’d recommend it both for business and leisure stays.",

This week I booked 2 stays, one in their new type room which was fine, the other in one of their older single rooms. The new room type doesn’t solve the issue that the rooms are noisy (you hear anyone who comes in and out of their own rooms) but the design is cute. Unfortunately my second stay had very dirty shower and toilet. I noticed it on the morning of my check out and mentioned it at the reception. Despite showing them how disgusting it was and explaining how gross it felt, their reaction was that they agreed it’s not right and will inform house cleaning. Clearly the issue isn’t only linked to a cleaner forgetting one time something (the dirt is well accumulated) but also how the reception staff is trained when facing such issues. At 200 euros per night this really isn’t acceptable for such issue to be taken lightly. Highly unprofessional and disappointing!",

From the beginning, it looked good, however, after staying here for a year I can definitely say that:\n1) Area is totally unsafe: robberies are not uncommon here. And be aware that staff won't help you in a dangerous situation, even on a territory of hotel, because they can't even protect themselves lol.\n2) Cleaning is one of the worst things here, they can ignore cleaning of your room for a months, so you have to come to the reception many times and ask to finally clean your room.\n3) Rude and useless staff (especially at the reception, as I already said)\n4) The price is too high for the absolute disregard for students that we end up with.\n5) Not only is the price high, but they also regularly fill the budget with fines for ridiculous reasons, or even without them (a few days ago, for example, they gave a fine 150 euros for a guy who shouted once in honor of successful end of the exam). 150 euros btw is a minimum fine here, so for every little thing you will pay exactly this amount.\n6) Rooms are small, many problems with bathroom. Alarm system can start to scream with no reason.\n7) They delete negative reviews, and it is already confirmed because they already deleted my negative comment at the beginning of the academic year when I faced troubles with cleaning.\n8) Very loud, for someone it is okay, but for guests who want quiet and cosy place - pick something else.\n9) One more thing about safety: if some guys will come and steal something from you, then the SH administration will say that they can't help you, that the cameras didn't record anything, or that they don't even have recordings as it was at first time.\n\nInteresting situation to conclude: We (students who live in the hotel) played table tennis late in the evening (it is not forbidden by the rules), and there were also 2 guests from the hotel (not students, but who came for a couple of nights). Everything was normal until an aggressive security guard came and rudely said that we can't play table tennis here anymore, so he took our rackets and told us to go to our rooms. But when we asked why he didn't care about hotel guests who also played (they started to play table tennis after security kicked us) he said that they are hotel guests and they can do everything. So the attitude towards students is simply disgusting as you can see. Not even gonna talk about winter rules when they literally made a prison instead of a hotel for students.\nOverall, this happens because they clearly understand that situation with housing in this country is really difficult, so they increase the price of living yearly (or even more often).\nBye-bye and never again!!",

It is nothing too stellar, but they do provide nice house cleanings and kitchen cleanings. However, the quality of the service remained the same, while the price of the long-term stay have noticeably increased. Now every contract price is around 200-300 euros more for the same living facilities.\nSecondly, the management's decision-making and attitude towards the residents has 100% gotten worse. The big door broke and does not close? Let's put a big chunk of wood blocking the entrance that is extremely inconvenient in emergency situation (guess what, a medical emergency DID HAPPEN, so they had to remove it and decided it to reinstall it right after, genius move)\nOh, there are SOME students that are loud in the smoking area? Let's restrict the smoking area after 10 pm and force students out of the perfectly safe space onto the street, where they are JUST AS LOUD, but where random people can pick a fight with them (had happened, and more than once). Genius idea👍, love collective punishment in a place im paying 1.2k for.\nThirdly, the location. Generally speaking, the location is alright. But during the year, we have had random people barging in, playing with gym equipment, jumping over the gate and provoking the students. One of the times a guy threatened a friend of mine with a gun, another time a random hobo was threatening me through a window. By far, the worst aspect of this place is the amount of freaks that I encounter unwillingly on a semi-regular basis WITHIN the bounds of the hotel.\nWould not recommend for more than one stay.",

It might be fine for a few nights as a tourist, but for students staying longer, it’s really not worth it.\n\nLet’s start with the positives:\nThe shared kitchen gets cleaned twice a week, which helps a lot. Laundry is free to use, which is nice — but there are only three washing machines and three dryers for the whole building, so it’s often a struggle to find one available. The staff are friendly and polite, and they do try to help when you ask.\n\nBut here’s what was frustrating:\nThere are no clear kitchen rules, so everyone just does whatever they want. It gets messy quickly, and not everyone respects shared spaces.\nMaintenance is very slow. My bathroom was clogged from the first day, and it took almost a week (and several reminders) before it was fixed. The shared kitchen had broken appliances (fridge, light, vent, dishwasher) for weeks, even though we were told someone would take care of it — nothing happened for a long time.\nThe kitchen is also too small for the number of people sharing it, which makes cooking stressful.\n\nMy room was spacious but quite dark because there wasn’t enough lighting. The walls are thin, so you can hear almost everything happening in the hallway or outside. The mattress was uncomfortable and uneven, and even after reporting it multiple times, nothing changed. The shower is very small, and the thin curtain causes water to spill everywhere.\n\nThere’s no door lock inside the rooms — which made me feel unsafe, especially as a solo female student.\n\nThe gym was another disappointment. It looks nice online, but it’s missing basic equipment like a squat rack and a leg press. There are only two benches and one mirror, which really isn’t enough for such a big place.\n\nI chose this place because I wanted a comfortable, hassle-free stay, even if it cost more (around €1,200/month). But in reality, it just didn’t live up to what was promised. For long-term students, I honestly think DUWO housing is much more worth it (around €600–700/month) — if you’re lucky enough to get a spot.",

Arriving late our first night it took us until the morning of our second night to notice black mold covering the bathroom. Upon telling the hotel they promptly moved us, but so much mold shows clear neglect. Using the laundry at the hotel was a super frustrating experience, as it's only usable through the hotel app, which simply did not work. The reception eventually managed to reserve us a washer, but were unable to get us a dryer due to technical issues, forcing us to leave a bag of wet clothes overnight. This hotel is nicer in theory than in practice.",

Pretentious under qualified staff, specially the ones managing the memberships! Kids, I'm guessing hired to make the place look hip but clueless about making a visit convert to business. No wonder all events r a fail here and the place has not picked up in its first yr. The place is strictly a hotel. Living in this space serves no benefit. It's incredibly expensive for facilities it cannot offer, The gym is way too small and always packed. The laundry room? For 1600€ a month u better have a laundry machine! The pools r not nice and awkward to swim when even few ppl r sitting around it. Most hotel guests r 50+ even tho Social Hub tries to be hip. The little cafe has random strict rules, unless u work or hotel guest u can only have to-go coffee apparently. Random new rule this week! The other doesn't allow laptops but it's always empty. Expensive coffee too. The management does not read the room of what Porto is and wants.",

Het hotel zit daardoor vol met studenten, wat niet ideaal is als je gewoon wilt ontspannen.\n\nDe faciliteiten vielen ook tegen. De kleine gym, het dakterras en de zitplaatsen waren vaak overvol. Het zwembad op het dak bleek meer een voetenbad en is eigenlijk alleen geschikt voor een foto, niet om echt in te zwemmen.\n\nDaarnaast viel de parkeerkosten erg tegen: €32,50 per nacht. Vijf minuten verder (ook lopend goed te doen) kun je parkeren voor €12 per nacht – een flink verschil.\n\nWat wel positief was: het personeel is vriendelijk, behulpzaam en de locatie is prima.\n\nConclusie: de prijs-kwaliteitverhouding klopt totaal niet.

This week I booked 2 stays, one in their new type room which was fine, the other in one of their older single rooms. The new room type doesn’t solve the issue that the rooms are noisy (you hear anyone who comes in and out of their own rooms) but the design is cute. Unfortunately my second stay had very dirty shower and toilet. I noticed it on the morning of my check out and mentioned it at the reception. Despite showing them how disgusting it was and explaining how gross it felt, their reaction was that they agreed it’s not right and will inform house cleaning. Clearly the issue isn’t only linked to a cleaner forgetting one time something (the dirt is well accumulated) but also how the reception staff is trained when facing such issues. At 200 euros per night this really isn’t acceptable for such issue to be taken lightly. Highly unprofessional and disappointing!",

The room we were given was very dirty, there was a sticky substance on the surfaces and walls, makeup on our pillows and black mold in the shower. We contacted the staff to let them know and they were very nice and gave us new pillows, we asked to change to a room without mold but none were available, they offered to try to change us the following day, but it never happened. We cleaned the surfaces of the room ourselves but unfortunately had to use a moldy shower for the duration of our stay in Amsterdam. Luckily, we didn’t get sick from the mold. No compensation was given to us.\n\nIn general the entire hotel felt dirty. I believe they need to seriously enhance their cleaning procedures. I would recommend not staying here and choosing a different hotel for your trip.",

It might be fine for a few nights as a tourist, but for students staying longer, it’s really not worth it.\n\nLet’s start with the positives:\nThe shared kitchen gets cleaned twice a week, which helps a lot. Laundry is free to use, which is nice — but there are only three washing machines and three dryers for the whole building, so it’s often a struggle to find one available. The staff are friendly and polite, and they do try to help when you ask.\n\nBut here’s what was frustrating:\nThere are no clear kitchen rules, so everyone just does whatever they want. It gets messy quickly, and not everyone respects shared spaces.\nMaintenance is very slow. My bathroom was clogged from the first day, and it took almost a week (and several reminders) before it was fixed. The shared kitchen had broken appliances (fridge, light, vent, dishwasher) for weeks, even though we were told someone would take care of it — nothing happened for a long time.\nThe kitchen is also too small for the number of people sharing it, which makes cooking stressful.\n\nMy room was spacious but quite dark because there wasn’t enough lighting. The walls are thin, so you can hear almost everything happening in the hallway or outside. The mattress was uncomfortable and uneven, and even after reporting it multiple times, nothing changed. The shower is very small, and the thin curtain causes water to spill everywhere.\n\nThere’s no door lock inside the rooms — which made me feel unsafe, especially as a solo female student.\n\nThe gym was another disappointment. It looks nice online, but it’s missing basic equipment like a squat rack and a leg press. There are only two benches and one mirror, which really isn’t enough for such a big place.\n\nI chose this place because I wanted a comfortable, hassle-free stay, even if it cost more (around €1,200/month). But in reality, it just didn’t live up to what was promised. For long-term students, I honestly think DUWO housing is much more worth it (around €600–700/month) — if you’re lucky enough to get a spot.",

I reviewed the “policy” carefully before booking and nowhere did it say that it is not guaranteed. But I was emailed about the morning check in “not possible” the day before arrival (past free cancellation) and weeks after booking. Sure enough, my room was not ready when I arrived. Second, staff. They all know how to smile but all (with an exception of the manager whose name I didin’t catch) act kind of arrogant and condescending. You are definitely not treated as a priority and it seemed nobody really cared.  Third, lobby/restaurant. Lobby is always  full of local hipsters working on their laptops. Usually, boutique hotels that have small rooms provide large lobby spaces for you to chill. Not here. There is no room for the hotel guests to hang out as all lobby seats/couches are taken by the “locals”.  The restaurant hours are odd and the food is below average. Last, the rooms have no sound isolation and my room did not have temperature control at all. It did not matter what you set the thermostat at, it would still be the same hot. Housekeeping during your stay is only upon request.  If you are from the US and have stayed at Pali hotels, this hotel offers the same style and amenity levels, just double/triple the price (and Pali I think has bathrobes and slippers too, but not here). I felt that it consistently overpromised and underdelivered. The main good thing about this hotel was the location right in the middle of Nine Streets,. It was also clean and the shower pressure was great. But that’s pretty much where the positives end. Would not stay here again. Pullitzer one block over seems like a way better choice.",

My sink had also been clogged or broken but I was told it could not be fixed for at least a day because I had checked in on a Sunday. An associate came to my room to try to help and used the room corkscrew to work on the plumbing — gross!!! Michaela jumped in and moved me to another room (which was much quieter as well, as a huge bonus — not a noisy one overlooking a very loud courtyard.) Thank you!!!\n\nHousekeeping was skipped for the first two days despite my explicit request. (Daily housekeeping is not provided by default.) I also found the room lacked adequate storage, as there was no room for laundry or drawers, forcing me to keep my clothes on the floor.\n\nMy experience in the lobby was also consistently frustrating. Every time I attempted to sit down, I was told to move. I was informed that I couldn't sit in the hotel lobby unless I purchased something, couldn't sit by the window without ordering food, and couldn't sit at a table if I had a laptop. This occurred three days in a row. On one occasion, I ordered a drink and answered emails while I waited. Not permitted! a waitress directed me to a bench behind the reception desk, which was already fully occupied. There is no signage and no explanation of this. You must learn by chastisement.\n\nAdditionally, I was unable to use the hotel's bikes as intended. I was told that bikes could not be kept past 10 PM, making it impossible to bike to dinner. For several consecutive days, when I inquired about a bike, I was told that the six complementary hotel bikes were taken and that I was welcome to go to a hotel-recommended store if I still wanted to rent one.  Of course I can rent one! Dont advertise a free bike program if your advice is to go to another company to spend money. Finally, I was surprised that staff insisted on collecting my borrowed umbrella nightly; the €20 rental hold was apparently not enough for them to be convinced I wasn’t going to steal it overnight. (@hotel: I promised not to steal it...

The mattress was some sort of springy bed, that sagged and had no proper support.  A hotel on this level should offer a proper bed.  This one should have been thrown out years ago.\n\n#2.  The air conditioner was on, but provided nothing.  There was no cool air and didn’t even move the air.  From entering the first time the room was consistently stuffy with stagnant air.  The windows of room 108 on the first floor couldn’t be opened either. It was always warmer in the room than it was outside. After bringing it to the attention of the front desk, a fan was provided that did help. But the temperature of the room remained warm for our 3 day stay.\n\nOn positive notes, the location is great. The restaurant and lounge is beautiful. Staff was friendly and did what they could to help.\n\nDecided to have breakfast in the lobby restaurant “Lottis” our last morning.  Service was fine, but my salmon benedict had some small grit in the chew.  I removed the sautéed spinach from the 2nd half and there was then no grit.  I suspect the spinach wasn’t properly washed before.\n\nI stayed in 4 other hotels during my Europe trip and The Hoxton was disappointing.

However was really disappointed by the lack of cleanliness of our room. The toilet seat was stained, the shower clearly hasn't received a deep clean in ages. Overall felt like it was only cleaned superficially and in a rush.\nThe beds are the absolute worst, as you are lying on a board of MDF with a mattress on top, which creaks if you move even a little bit, so not for light sleepers and uncomfortable as well. Water pressure in the shower is really low and since it's one of the newer hotels, you can't open the windows which of course is just my personal preference.\nThe staff was nice and apart from the cleanliness don't think they could do anything to change our experience, but would not come again.",

Housekeeping during your stay is only upon request.  If you are from the US and have stayed at Pali hotels, this hotel offers the same style and amenity levels, just double/triple the price (and Pali I think has bathrobes and slippers too, but not here). I felt that it consistently overpromised and underdelivered. The main good thing about this hotel was the location right in the middle of Nine Streets,. It was also clean and the shower pressure was great. But that’s pretty much where the positives end. Would not stay here again. Pullitzer one block over seems like a way better choice.",

          "text": "Felt unwelcome and untrusted. Death by a million papercuts:\n\nUpon entering my room, I had been left dirty glassware. My sink had also been clogged or broken but I was told it could not be fixed for at least a day because I had checked in on a Sunday. An associate came to my room to try to help and used the room corkscrew to work on the plumbing — gross!!! Michaela jumped in and moved me to another room (which was much quieter as well, as a huge bonus — not a noisy one overlooking a very loud courtyard.) Thank you!!!\n\nHousekeeping was skipped for the first two days despite my explicit request. (Daily housekeeping is not provided by default.) I also found the room lacked adequate storage, as there was no room for laundry or drawers, forcing me to keep my clothes on the floor.\n\nMy experience in the lobby was also consistently frustrating. Every time I attempted to sit down, I was told to move. I was informed that I couldn't sit in the hotel lobby unless I purchased something, couldn't sit by the window without ordering food, and couldn't sit at a table if I had a laptop. This occurred three days in a row. On one occasion, I ordered a drink and answered emails while I waited. Not permitted! a waitress directed me to a bench behind the reception desk, which was already fully occupied. There is no signage and no explanation of this. You must learn by chastisement.\n\nAdditionally, I was unable to use the hotel's bikes as intended. I was told that bikes could not be kept past 10 PM, making it impossible to bike to dinner. For several consecutive days, when I inquired about a bike, I was told that the six complementary hotel bikes were taken and that I was welcome to go to a hotel-recommended store if I still wanted to rent one.  Of course I can rent one! Dont advertise a free bike program if your advice is to go to another company to spend money. Finally, I was surprised that staff insisted on collecting my borrowed umbrella nightly; the €20 rental hold was apparently not enough for them to be convinced I wasn’t going to steal it overnight. (@hotel: I promised not to steal it... It is in my room right now; please do not go upstairs and take it away from me, I want it for when it's raining later.)\n\nI hope they will address these issues. Michaela at the front desk was extraordinarily helpful with many of the issues I encountered and she is fabulous, going well above and beyond. Truly exceptional!!!!\nUnfortunately one helpful and attentive associate does not completely compensate for feeling thoroughly untrusted and unwelcome. This is not a cheap hostel! My stay was €500 per night! I expected a high quality comfortable stay; if I had known the issues, I would have stayed elsewhere. And bought myself a brand new umbrella every day.",

However was really disappointed by the lack of cleanliness of our room. The toilet seat was stained, the shower clearly hasn't received a deep clean in ages. Overall felt like it was only cleaned superficially and in a rush.\nThe beds are the absolute worst, as you are lying on a board of MDF with a mattress on top, which creaks if you move even a little bit, so not for light sleepers and uncomfortable as well. Water pressure in the shower is really low and since it's one of the newer hotels, you can't open the windows which of course is just my personal preference.\nThe staff was nice and apart from the cleanliness don't think they could do anything to change our experience, but would not come again.",

When I asked, they acted like I was bothering them and I had to ask multiple times.\n\nMy teacups were replaced with dirty ones that had a lipstick mark on them.\n\nPlastic cleaning gloves were left in the bathroom sink.\n\nRestaurant staff will leave you sitting there for 30 mins without water. One waiter spilt my coffee all over the table and just walked off and didn’t bother to come back to clean it.\n\nI left my room key at reception for someone to pick up, they lost it before the person even arrived.\n\nWhen I arrived at 7:00am, the day of check-in, there was a man behind the coffee bar on his phone who did not once look up or offer to help me with my luggage. He just listened to me struggle across the cobble stones with two large suitcases.\n\nI know this isn’t a five star establishment but for four stars and 450 euro per night, I’d expect the basics.\n\nI am always polite and friendly, even when asking multiple times for things, so I know they weren’t just ‘sticking it to me’ for having a bad attitude.\n\nTwo of my colleagues stayed at the same time and had similar issues.\n\nSave your money and stay at a boutique hotel where they will provide attentive service.",

The mattress was some sort of springy bed, that sagged and had no proper support.  A hotel on this level should offer a proper bed.  This one should have been thrown out years ago.\n\n#2.  The air conditioner was on, but provided nothing.  There was no cool air and didn’t even move the air.  From entering the first time the room was consistently stuffy with stagnant air.  The windows of room 108 on the first floor couldn’t be opened either. It was always warmer in the room than it was outside. After bringing it to the attention of the front desk, a fan was provided that did help. But the temperature of the room remained warm for our 3 day stay.\n\nOn positive notes, the location is great. The restaurant and lounge is beautiful. Staff was friendly and did what they could to help.\n\nDecided to have breakfast in the lobby restaurant “Lottis” our last morning.  Service was fine, but my salmon benedict had some small grit in the chew.  I removed the sautéed spinach from the 2nd half and there was then no grit.  I suspect the spinach wasn’t properly washed before.\n\nI stayed in 4 other hotels during my Europe trip and The Hoxton was disappointing.  Otherwise Amsterdam was charming but an uncomfortable hotel.",

Auch die Cocktails sind erstklassig – der Gin Tonic gehört zu den besten, die ich je getrunken habe.||Die Zimmer sind, typisch für London, eher kompakt, dafür aber makellos sauber, stylisch eingerichtet und mit liebevollen Details ausgestattet. Besonders praktisch ist die kleine Musikbox, mit der man Radio hören oder sein iPhone verbinden kann.

After a bit of argument about it (most unpleasant) we left the bar without eating or drinking and went elsewhere for dinner. Having heard nothing further re an explanation or compensation, I chased up an explanation for the booking error. At this stage it was again claimed I had made the mistake and I had to show proof I had not. The manager then blamed the booking agency (Disloyalty) and said any compensation would have to come from them. The issue with the drinks was shrugged off as ‘standard policy’ (we have stayed at this hotel 7 times and previous complimentary drinks were provided without any such issues). To cap it all at checkout I was charged for breakfast bags which on my last 2 visits (they were all booked together) were free. Apparently it was a special offer to drum up trade. At that point I had had enough arguing. My visit was ruined. I spent a good deal of it in the room too stressed out and upset to do all the things we had planned. I won’t be back. I suspect the staff will just be relieved as I presume I was considered a nuisance the whole time.",

My sink had also been clogged or broken but I was told it could not be fixed for at least a day because I had checked in on a Sunday. An associate came to my room to try to help and used the room corkscrew to work on the plumbing — gross!!! Michaela jumped in and moved me to another room (which was much quieter as well, as a huge bonus — not a noisy one overlooking a very loud courtyard.) Thank you!!!\n\nHousekeeping was skipped for the first two days despite my explicit request. (Daily housekeeping is not provided by default.) I also found the room lacked adequate storage, as there was no room for laundry or drawers, forcing me to keep my clothes on the floor.\n\nMy experience in the lobby was also consistently frustrating. Every time I attempted to sit down, I was told to move. I was informed that I couldn't sit in the hotel lobby unless I purchased something, couldn't sit by the window without ordering food, and couldn't sit at a table if I had a laptop. This occurred three days in a row. On one occasion, I ordered a drink and answered emails while I waited. Not permitted! a waitress directed me to a bench behind the reception desk, which was already fully occupied. There is no signage and no explanation of this. You must learn by chastisement.\n\nAdditionally, I was unable to use the hotel's bikes as intended. I was told that bikes could not be kept past 10 PM, making it impossible to bike to dinner. For several consecutive days, when I inquired about a bike, I was told that the six complementary hotel bikes were taken and that I was welcome to go to a hotel-recommended store if I still wanted to rent one.  Of course I can rent one! Dont advertise a free bike program if your advice is to go to another company to spend money. Finally, I was surprised that staff insisted on collecting my borrowed umbrella nightly; the €20 rental hold was apparently not enough for them to be convinced I wasn’t going to steal it overnight. (@hotel: I promised not to steal it... It is in my room right now; please do not go upstairs and take it away from me, I want it for when it's raining later.)\n\nI hope they will address these issues. Michaela at the front desk was extraordinarily helpful with many of the issues I encountered and she is fabulous, going well above and beyond. Truly exceptional!!!!\nUnfortunately one helpful and attentive associate does not completely compensate for feeling thoroughly untrusted and unwelcome. This is not a cheap hostel! My stay was €500 per night! I expected a high quality comfortable stay; if I had known the issues, I would have stayed elsewhere. And bought myself a brand new umbrella every day.",

We reserved the largest / most expensive room type in the property (“Biggy”), and were placed in a room on the 21st floor, which is one floor right below the rooftop nightclub which closes at 1am. There was loud dance music, vibrations from the bass, and people shouting that could be heard in our room until 1am, making it impossible to sleep. We were not given the option of having a quieter room when we checked in or when we booked - and the hotel only offered us a new room at 11pm on our final night, when my wife had already gone to bed. Are they running a hotel or a nightclub?\n\n2. We were not told at check-in on Friday night that we need to inform the hotel that we would like our room cleaned on Saturday - so when we returned to our room on Saturday night, we found it completely untouched - not even the bed had been made! The front desk then explained that the Hoxton has a sustainability policy, but I am not sure how not making the bed helps a hotel be more sustainable? We are not asking them to replace the sheets, just merely tidy the room. Might as well have stayed in an Airbnb!\n\n3. On the second night of our stay, we approached the front desk manager with our two complaints above, and he was apologetic - but then proceeded to give us a card with a stock/standard apology written on it about “apologies for the waiting time at check-in; please enjoy two drinks in the meantime” (that wasn’t even one of the issues we experienced!). This card entitled us to two free drinks in the bar, but it was 11pm when we received it and we were already in our room and checking out the next morning - so clearly we would have been unable to use it. It felt like a very impersonal, “tick-the-box” apology and the hotel staff did not really care about our concerns / complaints.\n\n4. The location of the hotel is pretty random - it’s not really in center city Brussels, next to some major roads. Fortunately we didn’t care too much about this.\n\n5.

It can be very crowded and noisy on the weekends —lots of locals come and hang out and drink at the bar. If you like to party late at night and don’t mind the noise, it’s great. If you want a quiet hotel, stay somewhere else or maybe don’t book here on a weekend. It’s conveniently located near the metro (Bonne nouvelle and grand boulevard stations) and walking distance to the louvre, seine, and opera. Breakfast can be included with your room and it’s a proper sit-down breakfast, not buffet, which is great. But service is very slow and the food comes out cold every time. I would skip the breakfast and go to a local boulangerie instead. The restaurant is the only thing that didn’t impress me, otherwise it’s a great hotel.",

The restaurant was also very good and provided many options throughout the day. We loved the location as it was a short walk to most of the iconic Paris spots, and easy to access.

My only downgrades were on 1) room service hours, but snacks were available at the front desk for a reasonable price; and 2) lighting in the rooms is with bare Edison style bulbs which is harsh. A softer shaded light source would have been nice. Also, amenities are limited in room—no cotton swabs or cotton balls and no wash clothes. All minor.

It was a little pricier than some others but worth every penny. They had a variety of rooms to fit different price points. The #1 feature was location. It was a quick walk to just about everything we wanted to do so no money was wasted on taxis/uber except for the 20 min ride to and from the airport. #2 I would say is the rooms. I felt like I was in my own little apartment. The rooms had tall ceilings, windows that were equally massive providing lots of natural light but also had black out curtains. I was on the first floor with canal views. Despite the winter cold (we went in January) the rooms warmed up and felt very cozy. #3 Was the bar/lounge area which was so comfortable and felt like my living room. I was able to get good drinks and work on my laptop with the other remote workers, and charge everything to my room. One recommendation would be to update Lotti’s lunch/dinner menu. Some heartier comfort meals and go-to classics would have been nice. The wifi was great the entire stay and the staff were friendly. I’d definitely go back.",

Extremely unpleasant communication that ruined our vacation. I checked in at your hotel on the afternoon of the 14th. Initially, I was impressed by the service and design aesthetics. However, my experience took a downturn when I encountered your night reception manager, he told me his name is JC.（sound）\n\nAfter attending a show with my girlfriend, we returned to the hotel at night and realized we had misplaced our room key. We approached the front desk to request a replacement. One of the staff members, a sturdily built male who resembled a bartender (the other was a female), assisted us. He asked for my passport, but I informed him that it was locked in the room. He chuckled and said he had many questions to “interrogate” me with, as he couldn’t just let anyone claiming to have lost their key into a room. I agreed, and he proceeded to ask about my booking details, email, and phone number. I believe I answered four questions correctly. As he was pondering a fifth question, my girlfriend and I suggested that I could provide other identification, such as my driver’s license. He smile and retorted, “Why didn’t you offer that earlier? It would have saved us both some trouble.” I thought to myself, why didn’t he ask if I had other ID? Who is serving whom here? He seemed more suited for interrogations at a police station than hospitality.\n\nDespite his arrogance, we didn’t want to argue, especially since it was Valentine’s Day. We resolved the issue, obtained the new key, and returned to our room.\n\nLater, I encountered another issue: my phone couldn’t connect to the Wi-Fi. I called the front desk for assistance. The staff member advised me to reopen the login page. When I explained that it wasn’t working, he became impatient and insisted I come down so he could handle my phone himself. Valuing my privacy, and having already been unnecessarily questioned about my phone, email, and bank details earlier, I asked if he could guide me through the process over the phone. He responded, “If you come down, I can help you; if not, there’s nothing I can do.” I was taken aback. Having stayed in numerous hotels worldwide, most strive to assist their guests. It’s rare to encounter such unhelpful staff. I calmly asked for his name, and he proudly declared, “I’m JC, the night manager.” I suspect this JC is the same individual who earlier questioned my service professionalism.\n\nI understand everyone has off days, but guests shouldn’t feel they’re being hassled, especially on special occasions when they’ve chosen your hotel for a memorable experience. It’s disappointing. Although a friend recommended your hotel, after this experience, I doubt I’ll return, as the service doesn’t align with the reputation and value I expected.",

We reserved the largest / most expensive room type in the property (“Biggy”), and were placed in a room on the 21st floor, which is one floor right below the rooftop nightclub which closes at 1am. There was loud dance music, vibrations from the bass, and people shouting that could be heard in our room until 1am, making it impossible to sleep. We were not given the option of having a quieter room when we checked in or when we booked - and the hotel only offered us a new room at 11pm on our final night, when my wife had already gone to bed. Are they running a hotel or a nightclub?\n\n2. We were not told at check-in on Friday night that we need to inform the hotel that we would like our room cleaned on Saturday - so when we returned to our room on Saturday night, we found it completely untouched - not even the bed had been made! The front desk then explained that the Hoxton has a sustainability policy, but I am not sure how not making the bed helps a hotel be more sustainable? We are not asking them to replace the sheets, just merely tidy the room. Might as well have stayed in an Airbnb!\n\n3. On the second night of our stay, we approached the front desk manager with our two complaints above, and he was apologetic - but then proceeded to give us a card with a stock/standard apology written on it about “apologies for the waiting time at check-in; please enjoy two drinks in the meantime” (that wasn’t even one of the issues we experienced!). This card entitled us to two free drinks in the bar, but it was 11pm when we received it and we were already in our room and checking out the next morning - so clearly we would have been unable to use it. It felt like a very impersonal, “tick-the-box” apology and the hotel staff did not really care about our concerns / complaints.\n\n4. The location of the hotel is pretty random - it’s not really in center city Brussels, next to some major roads. Fortunately we didn’t care too much about this.\n\n5.

However, my experience was entirely overshadowed by a grave safety issue and an appalling response from the staff.\n\nDuring my stay, the lift doors malfunctioned and forcefully closed on my shoulder, causing significant pain. When I reported the incident to the reception and later escalated it to the manager, the response was shockingly dismissive. The manager outright refused to review the CCTV footage and treated my concerns with disbelief and disrespect.\n\nIt is utterly unacceptable that a hotel which invests so much in aesthetics and guest experience would fail so profoundly in ensuring basic safety and professional conduct. A beautifully designed hotel is meaningless if the staff does not prioritise the well-being of its guests.\n\nI cannot, in good conscience, recommend this hotel to anyone, as no guest should have to endure such treatment—especially when reporting a safety concern.\n\n**Rating:** ⭐\n\n---\n\n**Schwerwiegendes Sicherheitsproblem und inakzeptable Reaktion des Personals**\nDas Hotel ist wunderschön gestaltet, mit viel Liebe zum Detail und einer Atmosphäre, die auf den ersten Blick einladend wirkt. Doch leider wurde mein Aufenthalt durch ein gravierendes Sicherheitsproblem und die erschreckende Reaktion des Personals völlig überschattet.\n\nWährend meines Aufenthalts klemmten die Türen des Aufzugs aufgrund eines technischen Defekts mit großer Wucht auf meiner Schulter, was erhebliche Schmerzen verursachte. Als ich den Vorfall der Rezeption und später dem Manager meldete, war die Reaktion schockierend gleichgültig. Der Manager weigerte sich kategorisch, die Überwachungskameraaufnahmen zu prüfen, und begegnete meinen Bedenken mit Unglauben und Respektlosigkeit.\n\nEs ist schlichtweg inakzeptabel, dass ein Hotel, das so viel in Ästhetik und das Gästeerlebnis investiert, bei grundlegenden Sicherheitsmaßnahmen und professionellem Verhalten derart versagt. Ein schönes Design ist bedeutungslos, wenn das Personal nicht die Sicherheit und das Wohlbefinden der Gäste an erste Stelle setzt.\n\nIch kann dieses Hotel nicht empfehlen, denn kein Gast sollte so behandelt werden—insbesondere nicht, wenn er ein Sicherheitsproblem meldet.\n\n**Bewertung:** ⭐",

(Video attached)\n\nThe design is smart, space-efficient, and everything from the bed to the bathroom setup feels sleek and modern. 🛏️🚿\n\nOne of the coolest features is the mood lighting, you can actually change the colors while you shower, which makes it feel a bit trippy and fun. Definitely adds to the experience .\n\nOverall, it’s not a traditional hotel vibe, but if you’re into modern design and clever tech touches, it’s a memorable place to stay.\n\nRatings:\n🛏️ Room Comfort & Design: 4.5/5\n🛎 Service & Ambience: 4/5\n💸 Money’s Worth: 4/5\n\nTip: Don’t miss playing around with the shower lighting; it’s part of the fun!",

And the price was lower than I thought, so I had to ask my friends in Rotterdam if this is a hostel room or no.\nwhen I made the reservation, I wrote a comment for requesting a view for Oude Haven. I did not even know if they read it but when I arrived to my room, I understood they read it! And I asked this after checkout if they read it, they said yes and they specially gave me that room. Thanks for that again.\nMy room was super useful. Small room but have all what I need for this stay! and I loved how you adapted technology to hotel room. I was able to control everything with the tablet near of my bed, even air conditioner & curtains!\nI did not had much things to talk with staff but whenever I had to talk them, they were super friendly & helpful.\nif I ever come to Rotterdam again, I will definitely stay in this hotel.\nand a little tip to football fans. if you are coming to Rotterdam for a football game against Feyenoord, Oude Haven is the meeting point for away fans before the game. and this hotel is located just in there. so, you can't find a better place than this.\nthanks again.",

They bought a hot chocolate. I came back and joined them, and was told it cost 29.99Euros to sit there, I said it was only for 15 minutes whilst they finished their call. The worker said fine and said I needed to buy something. I mean, fine, I asked them for a hot chocolate but was told, clearly, they don't do waiter service. So I went and bought another hot chocolate, gave it to my colleague and waited in the bar area, I was told I had to be if I didn't pay the 29.99working rate for the office. Fine.||My colleague came back and the person came to talk to us and I said \"I'll take a beer and another hot chocolate\". I was then informed because my colleague had been there, for an hour they must pay 29.99Europs now otherwise they can't buy food or drink. I said, \"Just so I get this, I can only buy them a drink, if they pay 29.99 but I can buy something for myself ?\", yes was the reply.||They will literally REFUSE to take your money, unless you pay a 29.99 fee first. They told me it was because it was prioritising their guests who wanted to use the facilities. It was empty, loads of empty tables there.||I'd heard of \"bar fines\" in the go-go bars of Thailand where you have to pay money to the owner if you take a worker home, but I'd never heard of being charged to buy drinks in the West.

They bought a hot chocolate. I came back and joined them, and was told it cost 29.99Euros to sit there, I said it was only for 15 minutes whilst they finished their call. The worker said fine and said I needed to buy something. I mean, fine, I asked them for a hot chocolate but was told, clearly, they don't do waiter service. So I went and bought another hot chocolate, gave it to my colleague and waited in the bar area, I was told I had to be if I didn't pay the 29.99working rate for the office. Fine.||My colleague came back and the person came to talk to us and I said \"I'll take a beer and another hot chocolate\". I was then informed because my colleague had been there, for an hour they must pay 29.99Europs now otherwise they can't buy food or drink. I said, \"Just so I get this, I can only buy them a drink, if they pay 29.99 but I can buy something for myself ?\", yes was the reply.||They will literally REFUSE to take your money, unless you pay a 29.99 fee first. They told me it was because it was prioritising their guests who wanted to use the facilities. It was empty, loads of empty tables there.||I'd heard of \"bar fines\" in the go-go bars of Thailand where you have to pay money to the owner if you take a worker home, but I'd never heard of being charged to buy drinks in the West. Didn't realise it was THAT sort of bar....||I've stayed in the Savoy, The Ritz, The Shard, fortunate to stay in the world';s top hotels but never come across this. I honestly thought it was a joke when he was telling me. I guess they've got too much money already because they lost out on 2x sales right there.",

I stayed in a room facing the inner garden which was quiet enough to get some good sleep. The morning autumnal walk to RAI across the park was pleasant, especially since it wasn't raining.

Let me break down my 5-day stay experience:\n\nThe good: Superior room automation (everything controlled via tablet), excellent WiFi connectivity, convenient location for business travelers, and handy luggage lockers. The building has Lime bicycle stations right outside, and the vibrant nightlife across the street is a plus.\n\nThe bad: The room design is bizarrely impractical with a sink placed awkwardly in the sleeping area, and rooms are surprisingly smaller than budget hotels like Travelodge. The £20 breakfast feels overpriced for the limited variety offered.\n\nThe ugly: The elevator situation is an absolute nightmare - 80% of the time they're out of service, forcing guests to wait endlessly or use stairs. Staff seemed indifferent to these issues. Rooms facing the metro line suffer from significant noise intrusion, though internal soundproofing is decent.\n\nWhile the location is prime for Shoreditch exploration and business trips, the consistent elevator problems, basic amenities, and cramped rooms make it hard to justify the premium pricing. You're essentially paying for the trendy brand name rather than superior comfort or service.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

I came back just to write this review because I got reminded of how traumatic my stay was. The room felt like living in a coffin - it was that tiny and stuffy. They provide ZERO room service in a 4 star hotel which is just ridiculous actually even low star hotels have room service someone needs to rebuke their stars or the hotel brand needs to go out of business. I would never stay here of my own accord I only stayed there because I was forced to by my job. I was staying there in winter and they don’t provide any adequate bedding or pillows, don’t allow deliveries to the room which is ridiculous because then why don’t your staff just deliver it?? Also the thermostat is always broken. They don’t provide enough towels you always have to request everything - even a simple room cleaning. it doesn’t feel like staying in a hotel it feels like your staying at a place where you are unwelcome. The people who created this hotel should really take a course on hospitality or learn something from the east where even lower star hotels provide good hospitality. The whole place is cheaply done. The lights are glitchy. I wish they would just go out of business. The sinks are smaller than airplane sinks water just gets all over your place. Even apartments in nyc are bigger than these rooms",

Non mi piace lasciare recensioni negative, ma ci sono stati alcuni fattori che hanno reso la permanenza poco piacevole.\nPRO:\n1. letto king size con topper comodissimo\n2. Posizione comoda per spostarsi sia in treno verso l’aeroporto e altre città, sia verso il centro con il tram che ferma praticamente davanti\n3. Ambassador sempre disponibili e pronti ad aiutarti\nCONTRO:\n1. La stanza era freddissima. Abbiamo chiesto di alzarci la temperatura, aspettato che si aggiornasse il sistema, ma in camera si moriva di freddo. Si potrebbe pensare di far andare il clima solo per qualche ora dalle 11 alle 15 e lasciare agli ospiti la scelta di accenderlo o meno anche di notte. Così è insopportabile. Non vedevamo l’ora di uscire.\n2. Le pulizie totalmente da rivedere. Al check-in ore 15.30 la stanza non era ancora pronta, nei giorni seguenti le pulizie venivano fatte nel tardo pomeriggio quando rientravamo. Un giorno non ci hanno messo la carta igienica, poi mancavano gli asciugamani e un altro giorno proprio non le hanno fatte anche se erano state richieste.\n3. Il bagno così allestito con wc e doccia divisi in due sorte di cilindri sono molto scomodi. Anche la zona per riporre le cose è poco pratica rispetto ad altri hotel della stessa catena.

There was not noise from outside even with picking the Westward train viewing room.\n\nI did not try any food on site, so I can't speak to that but the lobby was spacious and chill looking.",

          "text": "A high tech hotel in the heart of a trendy neighborhood, the citizenM hotel Shoreditch was an ideal place for a couple visiting London for the first time. Shoreditch is on the West and North side of London. Close to the downtown area, Shoreditch was within walking distance to tube stations and buses. Liverpool Street station is not far from the hotel and from there you can go anywhere in the city. We walked down the A-10 to the OXO building and had a reservation for the Sky Garden at OXO. The number 8 bus stop is about a block away from the hotel outside the Shoreditch High Street station making it easy to navigate to St. Paul's Cathedral or along the Thames River. Our room had a king size bed with a beautiful shower and a small/narrow sink and makeup table. There is an iPad next to the bed to control the lights, temperature, and television. You can order room service or visit the 24-hour lounge on the second floor behind the reception area. One night after coming back to the hotel after 10 PM we ordered a plate of nachos and ate in a quiet corner of the restaurant. You can pre-order breakfast for £13 per person (£16 same morning) or take a short walk across the courtyard to a coffee shop. There are two restaurants also located just outside the hotel and lots of small pubs and places to eat close by. CitizenM was a convenient place to stay in London for sightseers and those who want an upscale, tech hotel for a good price.",

          "text": "The citizenM Hotel is about a 10-minute walk from Liverpool Street and well connected to all major stations. Reception is on the first floor with a self-check-in system, which unfortunately didn’t work for us. The rooms and the hotel overall are very clean and well maintained. There is only one type of room: for two people with a toilet and shower. With lots of luggage, the room feels cramped, but it’s manageable. The shower and toilet are only separated by frosted glass. The entire room can be controlled by tablet, and a safe is provided. Despite the noisy surroundings, the hotel itself is very quiet and pleasant. The windows cannot be opened. Free Wi-Fi is available and worked well. The service was excellent: staff were always friendly and helpful. Requests like an extra blanket or towels were immediately fulfilled. The hotel bar is nice, offers a wide selection of drinks, and is open 24/7. We even received complimentary black tea. For two rooms and four nights, we paid over £1000 (without breakfast), which is acceptable for London given the location.\nSummary: Clean, friendly, and well-maintained hotel with small rooms at a high but fair price.\n\nOrginal German:\nDas citizenM Hotel ist etwa 10 Gehminuten von der Liverpool Street entfernt und gut von allen großen Bahnhöfen erreichbar. Die Rezeption befindet sich im 1. Stock, wo ein Self-Check-in möglich ist, der bei uns jedoch nicht funktioniert hat. Die Zimmer und das gesamte Hotel sind sehr sauber und ordentlich. Es gibt nur einen einzigen Zimmertyp: ein Raum für zwei Personen mit Toilette und Dusche. Mit viel Gepäck wird es schnell eng, es ist aber machbar. Die Dusche und Toilette sind nur durch Milchglas vom restlichen Raum getrennt. Das gesamte Zimmer kann über ein Tablet gesteuert werden, ein Tresor steht ebenfalls zur Verfügung. Trotz der lauten Umgebung ist es im Hotel sehr ruhig und angenehm. Die Fenster lassen sich allerdings nicht öffnen. Kostenloses WLAN ist vorhanden und hat stets funktioniert. Der Service ist ausgezeichnet: Alle Mitarbeiter waren freundlich und ansprechbar. Wünsche wie eine zusätzliche Decke oder Handtücher wurden sofort erfüllt. Die Hotelbar ist nett, bietet eine große Getränkeauswahl und das rund um die Uhr. Wir bekamen sogar kostenlos schwarzen Tee. Für zwei Zimmer und vier Nächte haben wir über 1000 £ (ohne Frühstück) bezahlt, was für die Lage und London insgesamt in Ordnung ist.\nZusammenfassung: Sauberes, freundliches und ordentliches Hotel mit relativ kleinen Zimmern zu einem zwar teuren, aber dennoch fairen Preis.",

Staff and food/Drink are available all night as well. The communal areas are great as well. It has included WiFi throughout the place/rooms.\nUnfortunately, when we tried to use the smart TV in the room, it did not work. The staff offered a room move but we had unpacked, it was late and we could not be bothered. So when you get in the room, check the TV before you settle in. They did offer us other compliantly offers. They do not have their own car park, so you have to sort out your own parking if you drive. Really good place to stay!",

First, I was surprised to find no slippers in the room, which is typically a standard offering at most hotels. When I asked about it, the response was “please buy it,” which felt a bit off for a hotel of this caliber.\n\nThe room itself was clean and well-maintained, which I appreciated. However, I would have liked to see complimentary bottled water in the room, as well as a liquid soap dispenser rather than the solid soap provided (including shampoo). It was a bit inconvenient for showering.\n\nOn a positive note, the breakfast was fantastic! It was definitely the highlight of my stay – great selection, fresh, and tasty.\n\nOverall, while the breakfast was excellent and the room was nice, I think Mama Shelter Luxembourg could improve in terms of amenities and customer service for a more complete guest experience.",

I was told that someone will come to fix it the next day but no one came. My hand was touching to the sink and dirty water at some point while washing my hands. There were flies in the room even though I didn’t open the window. The last day I saw a bug in the toilet. The toilet paper holder was loose. I went to the rooftop and ordered Roast-beef but they didn’t tell me there are 2; one with the hash-brown  and tomatoes and the other one is simple. So they brought the expensive one which was 10 Euro more. Also they charge you extra during the check in and they deduct from this amount when you consume food and drinks that was a bit confusing and unnecessary makes it hard to track. The rooftop was nice. The food was good at the restaurant. Breakfast was also good I had 2 times.",

It smells of cold, and water was leaking form the roof at several areas in the bar. Once, a drop from the roof, went directly into my wine. I left at that point. The air is overly humid due to poor drainage from the roof, which is slatted and opens. It probably needs maintenance. I notice both bartenders had a wet cough, indicating the air quality is unhealthy. If the smell of wet towels in the back of a car on a hot summer day, did not give the problem away. I feel the employees are used to the smell, but several people commented on the same.\n\nP.S. If you want evidence of the water drainage problems. Look at the security camera overlooking the bar. It is covered in red algae, and has water directly flowing over it to the bar floor.\n\nBest regards,",

Die Schilder wurden teilweise schon abgeräumt, sodass man nicht mehr genau wusste, was im Essen war. Es gibt auch gar keine Allergene, die angezeigt wurden. Man muss alles extra jeweils immer nachfragen und sogar da war die Servicekraft sich nicht sicher. Für mich gab es nicht mal was Vegetarisches mehr, außer verschiedene kalte Speisen. Es wurde auch keine neue Pizza mehr gemacht. Als wir ankamen, lag da anderthalb Pizza mit Speck. Bis um 16.00 Uhr wurde da nichts erneuert. Was sehr schade war, weil ich finde, wenn man bis 16.00 Uhr Brunch anbietet, muss man halt auch garantieren, dass die Leute immer noch für den gleichen Preis auch das gleiche Essen bekommen als eine Stunde davor. Oder man muss halt dann auch mit dem Preis runtergehen, wenn man dann schon abbauen möchte und kein neues Essen zubereiten möchte. Was ich sehr schade fand und auch viel zu teuer für 53 Euro, halt mit der Auswahl, die wir als Vegetarier hatten.",

Vamos lá aos factos…\n\nEra o aniversário da minha namorada, o que supostamente era para ser uma comemoração feliz e incrível com os nossos amigos. Ela havia escolhido o lugar pois ela já conhecia o Mama Shelter de outros sítios e, por gostar da vibe, imaginou que seria a mesma coisa aqui em Lisboa.\n\nO responsável pela loja naquela noite era o Fábio, que fez um comunicado desagradável e tendenciosamente arrogante ao meio da mesa, enquanto alguns dos nossos amigos estavam a fazer as suas refeições e a tomar os seus drinks, com o foco numa mensagem do tipo:\n“Para mantermos a mesa aqui, todos têm que consumir no mínimo 28€. Se todos não forem comer, acaba por não compensar”, e coisas do género…\n\nComo podem imaginar, por si só já foi extremamente desconfortável e frustrante, porque uma coisa é certa: não éramos todos que íamos comer ali, e visto que cada drink ali ronda os 15€ em média, não há dúvida de que a mesa ultrapassaria facilmente o valor de consumo por pessoa.\nO que claramente não foi feito devido a este aviso desconfortável e à falta de preparação tanto do Mama Shelter como estabelecimento, quanto dos seus funcionários. Claramente o Fábio deve ter feito o que lhe foi instruído, porém essa está longe de ser a forma correcta de lidar com o cliente final.\n\nEu e mais dois amigos fomos ter com ele, longe da mesa e dos restantes convidados, a fim de resolver a situação. No final, ficou resolvida, não tivemos de sair, mas certamente fez com que a nossa noite ficasse ali, estragada e manchada por ele.\n\nPretendo não voltar a este restaurante nunca mais, e recomendo que, antes de fecharem qualquer coisa a nível digital, liguem e esclareçam todas as dúvidas, porque em nenhum momento, até ao aviso desagradável do Fábio, foi-nos informado que cada pessoa teria de consumir pelo menos 28€ — o que, aliás, não seria problema para nenhum de nós.\n\nA única coisa que tive de deixar inicialmente — e que foi muito bem avisada — foi colocar os dados do cartão de crédito para assegurar 120€, caso não desmarcasse a tempo, o que é totalmente justo.\n\nSobre o estabelecimento: é muito barulhento, mesas demasiado próximas, climatização aquém, atendimento péssimo, decoração razoável — uma experiência digna de 1ou 2 estrela no máximo.\n\nSe quiserem experimentar, não recomendo. Mas tirem as vossas próprias conclusões.\n\nÀ equipa do Mama Shelter.",

Despite clearly waiting for quite a while, I was repeatedly skipped over when trying to order — three times in a row — in a way that felt personal. I was also the only person of color at the bar at the time, which made the situation feel even more pointed. Eventually, another guest had to speak up on my behalf, and the bartender seemed surprised to learn I was a member. What could have been an otherwise wonderful night was dampened by that interaction.",

It’s gorgeous and has everything you’d need for a stay in Amsterdam. The room service was amazing, the gym had everything you could possibly need, and the rooftop was gorgeous and the perfect place to take in views of the city. SoHo is a bit on the exclusive side, and does require membership for access. I’d advise to go with the friend membership, if you’re just wanting to try it out. They have locations all around the globe. Would highly recommend if you’re looking for something on the high end!",

From the moment I arrived, I was impressed by the warm and welcoming atmosphere created by the friendly staff. They were attentive, professional, and eager to assist with any questions or requests, which made me feel truly valued as a guest.\n\nThe hotel's location is fantastic—situated in the heart of Amsterdam, it offers easy access to many of the city's major attractions, charming neighborhoods, and vibrant nightlife. Exploring the city was a breeze, thanks to the convenient transportation options nearby.\n\nMy room was spacious, modern, and beautifully decorated, providing a perfect retreat after a day of sightseeing. The bed was incredibly comfortable, ensuring restful nights, and the amenities, including high-speed Wi-Fi and a well-stocked minibar, added to the comfort of my stay.\n\nOne of the highlights was the hotel’s stylish lounge and bar area, which was perfect for unwinding with a drink after a busy day. The ambiance was chic yet cozy, making it an ideal spot to relax.\n\nBreakfast at the hotel was delightful—offering a variety of fresh, high-quality options that catered to different tastes. The staff at the restaurant were attentive and friendly, contributing to a pleasant start to each day.\n\nOverall, my experience at Soho Amsterdam Hotel exceeded my expectations. The combination of excellent service, comfortable accommodations, and prime location makes it a top choice for anyone visiting Amsterdam. I look forward to returning on my next trip!",

Rooms are impeccable and all amenities you could need provided - toiletries to electricals, refreshments to full mini bar. All staff we spoke with were very helpful and friendly, from reception to the bar, and the pool, we never felt like a bother. We stayed during June heatwave so the pool was very busy, if you want to be lazy there on a sunny day (the drinks and food are lovely up there too) I recommend going up early or booking a cabana with the reception team when you check in. We arrived early and left our bags with reception who kindly gave us a water each and called us around 1 hour early to say the room was ready.

The building itself is beautiful, and the Cowshed spa team continues to deliver excellent quality, but beyond that, the experience has declined.\n\nService is inconsistent at best: staff are often untrained or inattentive, making it unnecessarily difficult to order even a simple drink. Toilets (especially upstairs in summer) are frequently in unacceptable condition, which is disappointing for what is also a hotel. Food quality is a hit-and-miss as well.\n\nMembership value has eroded. There are now large numbers of under-27 members paying half the fee, bringing in several guests and benefiting from extra discounts, which undermines the supposed exclusivity and professional community. Many don’t seem to be in creative industries at all. The “no photo / no call” policy is no longer enforced, so the space feels more like a backdrop for selfies than a members’ club.\n\nI’ve raised these issues with membership managers over the years, they acknowledged service and community challenges, but nothing changed. Ironically, I only received a follow-up call once my membership cancellation had already gone through.\n\nSoho House Berlin still has the potential to be special, but as it stands, the standards have slipped too far. The spa team deserves recognition for maintaining quality, but the rest of the House needs serious attention.",

The most frustrating part wasn’t even the lack of service—it was the sheer chaos. The place was packed to the brim with people on laptops working anywhere they could find space, including standing up at a chest of drawers outside the toilets. Others were pacing around on calls, and some were even taking business calls inside the photo booth. Is this supposed to be a private members’ club or just a crowded Gen Z co-working space?\n\nThe atmosphere was completely lost in the chaos. Finding a comfortable place to sit was impossible unless you arrived ridiculously early, and if you did manage to find a spot, you were wedged between people typing away on laptops or loudly discussing their start-ups. It felt more like a disorganised WeWork than an upmarket social space.\n\nOn top of that, the service was nonexistent. I didn’t see a single waiter the entire time, wasn’t offered a menu, and had to bring my own water and food from outside—at a private club with a hefty membership fee.\n\nThis isn’t a one-off bad experience; it’s clearly a fundamental problem with how the House is being managed. Given that this is the only Soho House in Barcelona, I know of members who are seriously reconsidering whether their membership is even worth it anymore.\n\nUnless something drastically changes, I wouldn’t recommend Soho House Barcelona to anyone looking for an exclusive, stylish, and relaxing place to socialise. Right now, it’s just an expensive, overcrowded mess.\n\nJoin any or all of the London houses if you can, but don’t bother in Barcelona.",

Unfortunately the place gets full of business guys in business casual attire doing lame business meetings. I heard Soho House was different? I guess not? Whatever.\n\nThe food and drinks here are really good. They have guest chefs and a really solid cocktail menu. Once they even had a special cocktail menu to match the guest chef. Really cool. Coming here for a cocktail on the roof at the end of a night out can be really special and relaxing.\n\nUnfortunately the staff here always hassles you here to order something if you're just sitting and chilling on your phone or computer. Seems like you can't escape someone asking you if you're okay or if you want to eat or drink something. Also related: they pressure you for a tip afterwards. Specifically was asked once with that weird tactic \"what would you like the total to be?\" 🙄  I guess Soho House isn't paying it's staff well enough? Honestly I didn't expect them to even take tips as it's kind of tacky and weird to make your servers fight for tips… just pay them well, it's easy.\n\nIf you're coming here to get some work done, be prepared to eat or drink something. Like, I don't know why this wasn't clear before I became a member, but Soho House is basically just a huge restaurant. Apparently even the designated coworking space in the back is \"a restaurant.\" I once brought some of my own food in to eat while working and was told I couldn't eat while working \"because this is a restaurant.\" Mind you, I'm working in the very back corner of the downstairs area (the area designated for working). Funnily enough, when I visited Soho House Paris, I felt totally comfortable and welcomed by the staff. I didn't even stay at the hotel, and was only coming there to work on a daily basis, and still it was really lovely and the staff made me feel so welcome. But nah, there is no where in Soho House where you can just chill without being constantly bothered to buy something.\n\nA note on the gym: if you're serious about lifting weights, it can often be a struggle to get in a good workout. While the gym area is pretty big, with really nice equipment, it's almost always full. And with only a single bench press, and only a single cable weight machine, I often found myself waiting on someone to be finished. Meanwhile there are like 10 treadmills and 5 peloton bikes, so if you want to do cardio, you're good.",

La posizione è praticamente perfetta, a due passi da piazza Dam e con vista sui canali questa location non vi deluderà. La vista dal rooftop è in generale da tut te le finestre è veramente bella e caratteristica. Parlando delle stanze: avevo letto molte recensioni che si lamentavano dei rumori quindi prima di prenotare mi sono fatta assicurare di avere una stanza lontana dal club e da tutti i possibili disturbi. La nostra stanza categoria Small numero 42 era silenziosa e con vista sul canale e con abbastanza spazio e luce. Letto comodissimo, abbiamo dormito molto bene. Prodotti bagnoschiuma, pettini, creme in dotazione nella stanza meravigliosi. Aumenterei la luce in bagno. Oppure aggiungerei degli specchi trucco con la luce forte. Durante il soggiorno ho approfittato della palestra (meravigliosa) e del centro massaggi. Vi consiglio di prenotare un massaggio con l’operatore Siwat, non ve ne pentirete. Per quanto riguarda le cose da migliorare: l’area della piscina secondo me necessita di un po’ di lavoro. I letti dove fanno sdraiare gli ospiti non vengono puliti e sistemati tra un’ospite e l’altro quindi non è molto invogliante sdraiarsi in costume vedendo un materasso sfatto e pieno di briciole. Mi è capitato due volte su due. La piscina è molto piccola come nella maggior parte delle SoHo House, ma la vista è molto bella. Un’altra cosa che inizierei a considerare fossi in loro è la possibilità di prevedere una colazione anche piccola da includere per gli ospiti dell’hotel. Farei un refill dei biscottini inclusi ne avevano lasciati solo due e visto che non c è la colazione almeno i biscotti nella postazione potrebbero rimetterli ogni giorno in quantità un po’ maggiori. Il personale è stato gentile e disponibile con noi, niente da dire. Attenzione alle chiavi della vostra stanza: se le perdete vi caricano 250 euro sul conto.",

It's over-crowded by 9am all summer and absolutely filthy. They don't clean it on mornings after a busy day so be prepared to swim around in nothing but garbage from the day before.\n\nIf you're a member so that you can attend the events, their booking system is awful. You can never get tickets to anything (even right when they release) and if you turn up to the events you always see the same handful of people inside. It's clearly not a fair allocations system at all, or whoever runs it is just giving access to friends before anyone else.\n\nOverall this place is not worth coming to, let alone the high membership fee associated unless you want to use it for the other houses globally",

Everything else, however, is a masterclass in chaos. The reception is unreliable, the tables in the club look like they haven’t seen a cleaning cloth in weeks, and most of the staff seem to have graduated from the “how to be rude 101” training program. With one shining exception, a single girl who was genuinely helpful, everyone else operates on the level of a budget hostel rather than a so-called five-star establishment.\n\nAnd let’s be clear: laziness cannot be justified by “Soho House values alignment.” It’s not charming, it’s not “community spirit,” and it’s definitely not “cool.” It’s simply unprofessional. That kind of attitude might fly in a place where guests stay for free and staff aren’t being paid, but when I’m paying full price, I expect at least the basics of hospitality.\n\nAt some point, I realized I was doing more work than the staff, and when you politely remind them that service is, in fact, their job, they somehow manage to take offense.

Oddly, the rooms have been designed around the concept of holding business meetings and the bed is viewed as something secondary/less important. The designer thought it more important to give their guests a giant table and hide the bed in an elevated cage. Fine, if you are a “young, single entrepreneur” who loves the nostalgia of childhood bunk beds and dens, not so great when you’re a middle aged couple, on their holiday. The chore of climbing over your sleeping other half to use the bathroom, highlighted how this room was designed on novelty, rather than function. The pointless gymnasium rings hanging from the ceiling supported this attraction to playful novelty.\n\nDo be aware of the constant hum of an air filtration system, with an extra vent inside your bed cage.\n\nWe did ask if we could change rooms, to a more conventional room with a bed accessible from both sides, but we were told they were designed for customers with disabilities and all were currently occupied.\n\nThe roof top reception lounge and restaurant is a great space, but this is taken over with people working and team meetings, so not somewhere you would be comfortable being, while on holiday. The breakfast is excellent, with good healthy options. The location is close to the metro station and university. 30 minutes walk into town.\n\nIf you value sleep and comfort, over team meetings, Zoku is not for you. It is not a great sign, when you look forward to going home, so you can finally get a good nights sleep.\n\nIf we visited Copenhagen again, we would stay more central, in a hotel that placed the bed as the most important part of the room.",

I had stayed here before, and at their property in Amsterdam a few years ago, and was always impressed with the properties - and why I rebooked here. I forgot there was a safe in the room  - so part of this issue is on me. I told reception about the money missing late Friday afternoon, and the kind staff person was apologetic and said he’d contact the manager to respond. About an hour later I checked in again, and was told the manager was reviewing video and would connect with me. No one followed up. I checked out this morning and still no response from the hotel. I appreciate the convenient location of the hotel, and the quality of the rooms, but I can’t stay here again if I’m left with any suspicion about theft; and the lack of response from management.\n\nMay 16 - Several folks contacted me wondering if there was any resolution.\n\nI contacted the hotel, as they suggested, but there was no response. I contacted them again about a week later, and they replied, and a phone call was arranged.\n\nI was up front about my mistake re: the safe, and acknowledging I agreed to the terms of their agreement when making a reservation which talks about lost/stolen property.\n\nThey admitted mishandling communication with me - in particular not contacting me between the time I reported the money missing on Friday afternoon until I checked out on Monday morning. They admitted they should have immediately offered to move me to a different room. They admitted they should have offered to assist me in making a complaint to the police. They said the hotel terminated the employment of the staff who was in my room from housekeeping. They apologized for the poor communication and their other mistakes.\n\nThey offered to give me a 15 percent discount on the cost of a future stay at any Zoku hotel, along with dinner and drinks. While I've enjoyed previous stays with them I don't consider that to be much of an incentive to trust the brand again.\n\nThey assured me actions have been put in place to ensure the situation doesn't happen again.",

We said there's no fire and asked for a minute since we were both undressed but they were shouting that we have to open the door immediately.\n\nThere's a smoking fine and they probably assumed we were lying and tried to \"catch us\".\nThey barged in, trampled on my clean clothes, opened a window, and left without an apology.\n\nAdditionally we had decided to extend the stay by 3 days. For 3 days our key cards stopped working and we had to reset them each time. To top it off there's no real reception, there's a bar on the top floor where the staff will help you when they finish making drinks?\n\nOverall it was disappointing. If you plan to use the kitchen, better do it fully dressed.",

Feels like you’re in room from a stylish version of IKEA.\n\nCons: Customer service is non existent, which killed our experience, plus rooms are stuffy and very small. When we had issues with the AC malfunctioning, the front desk did nothing to fix it and it took repeated calls to get it addressed. As a result, we spent 2 nights tossing and turning in an overheated room before the problem was fixed.  Location is in a business park that’s far from central Copenhagen and there are very few restaurants or places to see within walking distance. Lots of road noise\n\nConclusion: Not recommended",

          "text": "BEWARE OF THEFT. It’s unfortunate I have to post this but I think it’s important to note when choosing to stay at what you assume is a highly rated establishment. Similar to another review I’ve read here, Zoku housekeeping “could not find” an item I left in the room. This is extremely hard to believe given it’s at least $2000 euros in value and regardless of the value, the standard hotel policy is to hold onto a lost & found item for 90 days. I reported this missing item 4 days after my stay and it took them another 5 days with barely any correspondence in between to plainly tell me that housekeeping did not find it - not a single apology for even taking so long to reply. As others have also mentioned here, it’s likely the case that this item was discarded or stolen, both outcomes I deem very shocking for a hotel like this in Copenhagen.\n\nThe housekeeping staff in general is extremely rude and before this incident was disappointing. We were not informed during check in that we have to tidy our own rooms using the pantry on each floor, so we asked one of the housekeeping staff if we could just please have new towels. Instead of directing us to the pantry or handing us some towels from her cart, she literally scoffed at us that “it’s not possible” so we had to go all the way to the lobby to ask how we can get any towels or cleaning.",

Also, for first time guests arriving for breakfast seems odd as it feels like there is no one to help or 'check you in', the staff seem limited and often one waits to be let in to get a table.",

When we had issues with the AC malfunctioning, the front desk did nothing to fix it and it took repeated calls to get it addressed. As a result, we spent 2 nights tossing and turning in an overheated room before the problem was fixed.  Location is in a business park that’s far from central Copenhagen and there are very few restaurants or places to see within walking distance. Lots of road noise\n\nConclusion: Not recommended",

Room is nice, there's a small kitchen pantry in the room and a nice spacious table to sit and work. There's a unique and nice rooftop cafe/lobby/communal area on the 5th floor, the concept and interior design is cool/pretty/hygge style. I love how they have a chef cooking eggs in the morning for breakfast and sometimes the coffee taste really nice at the coffee machine.\n\nCons: However, when we first arrive, we got a bit confused, we can't tell that the rooftop is a lobby to check-in, a place to sit and relax/work or a cafe/bar? Appearently it's all in one 😅 there's a time I brought my own pastries to eat while waiting to collect my lugguage from the locker room, one of the staff rudely just went \"you can't eat outside food here\". If You have an integrated cafe/lobby/resting/working area all together, where was I suppose to sit and munch on my small pastry while I check out? The staff should have told me politely to not have something outside here or ask me if I want to buy a drink because I wanted to buy a coffee but no one attended to me so I grab a glass of water instead. Also, not alot of choices of food during breakfast, lunch and dinner. Although the Live music on Saturday night was good, it was too loud, I hardly can have a proper conversation while we sit, drink tea and relax cause we can't hear one another.\n\nWill I recommend this place to stay? Yes. But I would also recommend that staff is being trained well.",

On the positive side, the rooms are set up more like small serviced apartments, which is very convenient for longer stays. Having your own kitchen and a separate seating area adds a level of comfort and independence that standard hotel rooms often lack.\n\nAnother highlight is the rooftop terrace — beautifully decorated and offering a lovely view over Amsterdam. It’s a great spot to relax, and it's also accessible to non-hotel guests!\n\nHowever, the price point does not match the overall quality and experience. First of all, cleanliness is a real issue. While you can request cleaning, it is done very superficially. Stains and dust remain. This gives the entire place a neglected feel.\n\nBut the biggest disappointment was the overall environment. We had expected a more peaceful, community-oriented atmosphere with other long-term residents such as expats or professionals. Instead, the building feels more like a student dorm. Hallways are often messy, trash is left around, there’s a persistent smell of weed in the elevators and common areas, and noise at night is constant — with people slamming doors and shouting in the hallways, waking us up multiple times.\n\nWhile the hotel markets itself as a long-term living solution or community, it doesn’t live up to that promise. If you’re looking for a quiet, comfortable, and well-maintained place to stay for a longer period in Amsterdam, I would recommend looking into Airbnb options, renting an apartment, or spending a little more for a proper hotel experience. Unfortunately, this property falls short on many fronts — and for the price, it simply isn’t worth it for a longer period.\n\nSide note: Long-term guests only receive one free laundry cycle during their stay, which seems rather limited and not particularly guest-friendly. Additionally, we were left without coffee cups in our room for over two weeks due to “ordering issues” — small things, but they add up during a longer stay.",

On the positive side, the rooms are set up more like small serviced apartments, which is very convenient for longer stays. Having your own kitchen and a separate seating area adds a level of comfort and independence that standard hotel rooms often lack.\n\nAnother highlight is the rooftop terrace — beautifully decorated and offering a lovely view over Amsterdam. It’s a great spot to relax, and it's also accessible to non-hotel guests!\n\nHowever, the price point does not match the overall quality and experience. First of all, cleanliness is a real issue. While you can request cleaning, it is done very superficially. Stains and dust remain. This gives the entire place a neglected feel.\n\nBut the biggest disappointment was the overall environment. We had expected a more peaceful, community-oriented atmosphere with other long-term residents such as expats or professionals. Instead, the building feels more like a student dorm. Hallways are often messy, trash is left around, there’s a persistent smell of weed in the elevators and common areas, and noise at night is constant — with people slamming doors and shouting in the hallways, waking us up multiple times.\n\nWhile the hotel markets itself as a long-term living solution or community, it doesn’t live up to that promise. If you’re looking for a quiet, comfortable, and well-maintained place to stay for a longer period in Amsterdam, I would recommend looking into Airbnb options, renting an apartment, or spending a little more for a proper hotel experience. Unfortunately, this property falls short on many fronts — and for the price, it simply isn’t worth it for a longer period.\n\nSide note: Long-term guests only receive one free laundry cycle during their stay, which seems rather limited and not particularly guest-friendly. Additionally, we were left without coffee cups in our room for over two weeks due to “ordering issues” — small things, but they add up during a longer stay.",

The hotel is great both as a base to discover the city, or as a place to stay for some remote work.\n\nRooms: The interior design and setup of the lofts is absolutely genius (and calling them \"rooms\" wouldn't do them justice). It really does feel like your own cozy apartment in the city, with every appliance (including dishwasher) and every little accessory you can think of. The beds are very comfy, too. Every floor also has a (free) pantry with additional items to stock up your room.\n\nRooftop bar: The. View. Is. Gorgeous. Very solid drinks, too. And so many different seating areas: Tables to work at, couches to lounge in, bars to mingle at, tables to dine... The outdoor areas are great too, including several cute little more private areas on one side. The bar is also a great lounge-like space all day to get work done\n\nLocation: Very central, and super easy to reach with the subway.\n\nService: Absolutely outstanding. Everyone is super friendly and helpful. In interactions, I get the impression that the staff really enjoys working here. There was a (very, very minor!) issue with the stove vent in my room. I mentioned it, and was offered to be moved to a different room without even asking.\n\nAre there cheaper options to stay in Amsterdam? Yes. Are there better options to stay in Amsterdam? If you ask me, no. It's worth every penny.",

          "text": "BEWARE OF THEFT. It’s unfortunate I have to post this but I think it’s important to note when choosing to stay at what you assume is a highly rated establishment. Similar to another review I’ve read here, Zoku housekeeping “could not find” an item I left in the room. This is extremely hard to believe given it’s at least $2000 euros in value and regardless of the value, the standard hotel policy is to hold onto a lost & found item for 90 days. I reported this missing item 4 days after my stay and it took them another 5 days with barely any correspondence in between to plainly tell me that housekeeping did not find it - not a single apology for even taking so long to reply. As others have also mentioned here, it’s likely the case that this item was discarded or stolen, both outcomes I deem very shocking for a hotel like this in Copenhagen.\n\nThe housekeeping staff in general is extremely rude and before this incident was disappointing. We were not informed during check in that we have to tidy our own rooms using the pantry on each floor, so we asked one of the housekeeping staff if we could just please have new towels. Instead of directing us to the pantry or handing us some towels from her cart, she literally scoffed at us that “it’s not possible” so we had to go all the way to the lobby to ask how we can get any towels or cleaning.",

          "text": "A space designed for young entrepreneurs. Oddly, the rooms have been designed around the concept of holding business meetings and the bed is viewed as something secondary/less important. The designer thought it more important to give their guests a giant table and hide the bed in an elevated cage. Fine, if you are a “young, single entrepreneur” who loves the nostalgia of childhood bunk beds and dens, not so great when you’re a middle aged couple, on their holiday. The chore of climbing over your sleeping other half to use the bathroom, highlighted how this room was designed on novelty, rather than function. The pointless gymnasium rings hanging from the ceiling supported this attraction to playful novelty.\n\nDo be aware of the constant hum of an air filtration system, with an extra vent inside your bed cage.\n\nWe did ask if we could change rooms, to a more conventional room with a bed accessible from both sides, but we were told they were designed for customers with disabilities and all were currently occupied.\n\nThe roof top reception lounge and restaurant is a great space, but this is taken over with people working and team meetings, so not somewhere you would be comfortable being, while on holiday. The breakfast is excellent, with good healthy options. The location is close to the metro station and university. 30 minutes walk into town.\n\nIf you value sleep and comfort, over team meetings, Zoku is not for you. It is not a great sign, when you look forward to going home, so you can finally get a good nights sleep.\n\nIf we visited Copenhagen again, we would stay more central, in a hotel that placed the bed as the most important part of the room.",

Housekeeping had clearly rushed (if they even cleaned at all). There was dust on surfaces, hair in the bathroom, and the trash hadn’t been emptied. It was honestly disgusting and set the tone for the rest of the stay.\n\nI had already read another review about someone developing a rash from mislabelled toiletries, and unfortunately, I had a similar experience. I found a bottle labeled as body lotion, but it was clearly filled with body wash or shampoo. Completely unacceptable and honestly dangerous. This points to a pattern of negligence.\n\nIt’s clear the housekeeping team is understaffed or poorly trained—probably both. They’re not keeping up, and it shows.\n\nTo top it all off, the fire alarm went off in the middle of the night and blared for over 10 minutes, waking up the entire hotel. No explanation, no apology, just more chaos.\n\nThis hotel could be amazing—the design is cool and modern, and the idea behind it has potential. But it’s totally undermined by terrible management and lack of proper staffing. If you’re thinking of staying here, don’t just trust the photos—read the reviews.\n\nOne of the worst hotel experiences I’ve had in years. Definitely not worth the price or the stress.",

I had stayed here before, and at their property in Amsterdam a few years ago, and was always impressed with the properties - and why I rebooked here. I forgot there was a safe in the room  - so part of this issue is on me. I told reception about the money missing late Friday afternoon, and the kind staff person was apologetic and said he’d contact the manager to respond. About an hour later I checked in again, and was told the manager was reviewing video and would connect with me. No one followed up. I checked out this morning and still no response from the hotel. I appreciate the convenient location of the hotel, and the quality of the rooms, but I can’t stay here again if I’m left with any suspicion about theft; and the lack of response from management.\n\nMay 16 - Several folks contacted me wondering if there was any resolution.\n\nI contacted the hotel, as they suggested, but there was no response. I contacted them again about a week later, and they replied, and a phone call was arranged.\n\nI was up front about my mistake re: the safe, and acknowledging I agreed to the terms of their agreement when making a reservation which talks about lost/stolen property.\n\nThey admitted mishandling communication with me - in particular not contacting me between the time I reported the money missing on Friday afternoon until I checked out on Monday morning. They admitted they should have immediately offered to move me to a different room. They admitted they should have offered to assist me in making a complaint to the police. They said the hotel terminated the employment of the staff who was in my room from housekeeping. They apologized for the poor communication and their other mistakes.\n\nThey offered to give me a 15 percent discount on the cost of a future stay at any Zoku hotel, along with dinner and drinks. While I've enjoyed previous stays with them I don't consider that to be much of an incentive to trust the brand again.\n\nThey assured me actions have been put in place to ensure the situation doesn't happen again.",

When we had issues with the AC malfunctioning, the front desk did nothing to fix it and it took repeated calls to get it addressed. As a result, we spent 2 nights tossing and turning in an overheated room before the problem was fixed.  Location is in a business park that’s far from central Copenhagen and there are very few restaurants or places to see within walking distance. Lots of road noise\n\nConclusion: Not recommended",

Oddly, the rooms have been designed around the concept of holding business meetings and the bed is viewed as something secondary/less important. The designer thought it more important to give their guests a giant table and hide the bed in an elevated cage. Fine, if you are a “young, single entrepreneur” who loves the nostalgia of childhood bunk beds and dens, not so great when you’re a middle aged couple, on their holiday. The chore of climbing over your sleeping other half to use the bathroom, highlighted how this room was designed on novelty, rather than function. The pointless gymnasium rings hanging from the ceiling supported this attraction to playful novelty.\n\nDo be aware of the constant hum of an air filtration system, with an extra vent inside your bed cage.\n\nWe did ask if we could change rooms, to a more conventional room with a bed accessible from both sides, but we were told they were designed for customers with disabilities and all were currently occupied.\n\nThe roof top reception lounge and restaurant is a great space, but this is taken over with people working and team meetings, so not somewhere you would be comfortable being, while on holiday. The breakfast is excellent, with good healthy options. The location is close to the metro station and university. 30 minutes walk into town.\n\nIf you value sleep and comfort, over team meetings, Zoku is not for you. It is not a great sign, when you look forward to going home, so you can finally get a good nights sleep.\n\nIf we visited Copenhagen again, we would stay more central, in a hotel that placed the bed as the most important part of the room.",

Trotzdem wurde meiner Kollegin der Fika extra berechnet, obwohl dieser im Day Pass enthalten sein sollte. Zusätzlich wurden uns 2 weitere Day Passes verrechnet, obwohl unsere Freundinnen erst ab 14:00 Uhr kamen und nur vom Brunch-Menü bestellt haben.\n\nÜberraschend wurde heute auch der Seminarraum berechnet, obwohl dieser in der Vergangenheit nie extra verrechnet wurde (am 15. Juni wurde uns sogar ein Seminar ohne Aufpreis angeboten).\n\nBesonders unangenehm war, dass wir uns rechtfertigen mussten, weil eine Kellnerin falsche Annahmen getroffen hat – anstatt einfach nachzufragen. Das wirkte unprofessionell und war mir gegenüber meiner Kollegin peinlich, die ich kurzzeitig wegen eines Notfalls alleine lassen musste.\n\nAm Ende wurde die Rechnung zwar auf 34 € korrigiert (statt über 100 €), dennoch war die Situation unnötig stressig und unangenehm. Wir haben Zoku bisher gerne auch unseren Studenten zum Lernen empfohlen, werden aber künftig überlegen, ob wir Meetings noch hier abhalten.\n\nSehr schade – bisher war Zoku für mich immer ein Ort mit entspannter und transparenter Atmosphäre.

This hotel ranks as one of the top.  And it’s not because it’s some kind of big fancy posh hotel. Yes it is absolutely beautiful and the rooms have everything that you need - very spacious and adorable, down to the loft bed and the cute little touches like inspirational quotes on the wall and hanging exercise rings.  But there’s also just a feel that you get here that you don’t get everywhere. The staff are so down to earth and friendly and you can tell they really enjoy their jobs and their coworkers.  The food is also top notch. That chef really knows how to cook an egg perfectly - and it is an art.  When we had a boat ride one morning, they went out of their way to bring us towels and to-go boxes to pack up our breakfast for the morning. Everyone there is always smiling and in a good mood and ready to serve. It’s also really nice to have a hotel that has laundry services available when you are traveling for a long time.  There are also special relaxing places all over the hotel that most hotels do not have. It’s done in a really cozy way with swings and indoor plants and hammocks and unique touches all over the hotel that are kind of hard to describe until you get there. One example is sticky notes that guests can leave on one wall that explain what makes them smile. You kind of have to see it to understand but it feels more like a family there than just a hotel stay.  The other thing that’s really nice is the hotel is in a very quiet and peaceful part of town that is just a two minute walk to the metro and then just three stops on the metro to the main part of town, so the location is just ideal! I would stay here over and over again and obviously recommend it to anyone.",

The apartment/room was kitted out with everything we could need which is helpful to save some money to cook breakfast or dinner there. The pantry at the end of the corridor was great to restock should you need to (we just grabbed a couple wine glasses, was all we needed!). The loft area is a great addition with so many cool areas to sit and have a drink (really nice Hazy IPA on tap!). We had a pizza on the first night which was amazing, cooked fresh in the pizza oven! It is so conveniently close to the Metro which we hopped on multiple times a day. only about 5 minutes from the centre of Copenhagen but almost felt like you were out of the city with how quiet the area was.

As a digital nomad, I’ve bounced around dozens of coliving/workspaces, but Zoku is on another level. It’s rare to find a place that gets both living and working right, but somehow, Zoku nails both with style, thoughtfulness, and a good dose of fun.||The Loft: My home base was one of their Lofts — brilliantly designed with everything I needed to live and work comfortably. The modular layout is genius: a cozy bed tucked away, a proper desk with a comfortable chair and great lighting, and even a small kitchen. It felt like a little apartment, not just a hotel room. Everything is sleek, functional, and well thought through.||The Workspaces: What really sets Zoku apart is the coworking setup. I’d start my day with a fresh coffee on the rooftop terrace, then settle into the communal work area upstairs. Super fast Wi-Fi, plenty of outlets, natural light, and a vibe that somehow balances productivity with creativity. I met fellow remote workers and entrepreneurs from all over the world. It’s a built-in community that doesn’t feel forced.||One Friday night, I stumbled into a live music evening on the terrace which was magical. It’s one of the few places I’ve stayed where I felt genuinely connected rather than just passing through.||Location: Being based in Paris 17th was ideal. Quiet enough to get work done, but a quick metro ride away from all the buzz of central Paris. And Zoku itself feels like a calm oasis — creative, inspiring, and totally welcoming.||In short, Zoku Paris is the kind of place you plan to stay for a week… and end up extending for a month. If you’re a digital nomad looking for a place to work, live, and actually thrive in Paris — this is it!!",

I spend over 100 nights a year in truly excellent hotels, but what I experienced today was, unfortunately, tiring and frustrating.||I was traveling by car, and due to a large demonstration, access to the hotel was impossible — such things can happen, and one can prepare for that. However: there was no prior information about the situation, and the emails I sent to the hotel that morning went unanswered. Even by phone, it did not seem as though anyone wanted or was able to help.||I drove around Amsterdam for two hours, circling the demonstration, and was ultimately able to cancel (thank you for that!). When I asked why I hadn’t been informed, I was told that since I had booked through Amex Fine Resorts, they didn’t have my contact details. Yet both the spa and the restaurant had been booked in advance and confirmed to my personal email address. I also have a “Fans of MO” account, and Google could easily have helped.||For a Mandarin Oriental, where rates start at €900 per night, this was more than just a disappointment — it was a wasted Sunday.",

From the moment you walk in, you feel an overwhelming sense of warmth and elegance—it truly feels like home.\n\nThe hotel itself is breathtaking. Architecturally stunning and perfectly located in the Museum Quarter, it offers easy access to the best of Amsterdam’s culture, art, and charm. But what truly sets it apart is the people. The staff are among the kindest and most genuinely helpful individuals I’ve encountered. Every interaction felt personal and sincere.\n\nWe had a hiccup with our reservation, and Tina was absolutely amazing—so patient and kind while I tried to sort things out with a terrible connection from a moving train. She handled everything with grace and made what could’ve been stressful feel effortless.\n\nTo our delight, the hotel had left special gifts in the room for my kids—a thoughtful touch that meant so much to our family. Their attention to detail is unmatched.\n\nThe food? Extraordinary. Every bite was a delight, whether it was breakfast, room service, or dining in one of their exceptional restaurants.\n\nThis trip was extra special because I brought my children along for the first time. They were in awe and said it was the most beautiful place they’ve ever stayed. That says it all.\n\nIf you’re searching for a place to stay in Amsterdam—look no further. The Conservatorium is not just a hotel, it’s an experience. I honestly wish I had more reasons to travel to Amsterdam, just so I could stay here again. We will absolutely be back.",

Within walking distance to all prominent museums (Rijkmuseum, Van Gogh Museum, Stedelijk Museum, Moco museum) and right behind the luxury shopping street of Pieter Cornelisz Hooftstraat. We visited during winter so the Christmas market is also within walking distance. We had the duplex room which has an amazing ambience, high ceiling and very comfortable. However be warned that you have to climb up and down the stairs to get from the bed to the living room/wardrobe/toilet, which we kind of regretted after the second day of our stay. Otherwise the hotel also features a very nice spa and gym, as well as a few luxury shops in the building. The lounge area is very popular with non hotel guests as well. Service is exceptional. Our arrival flight was early, way before check in time, but they let us use the spa shower facilities to freshen up. Both concierge and front office staff are very helpful and friendly too.

Second and worst part was that i left my leather hugo boss backpack with my 500eur tomford sunglasses inside under the table where we were seated , I called the hotel the next day and was told nothing was found! I told them to check the security cameras and find out what happened to my backpack, it was around 7:30pm when we left, they were  not interested just like when I called earlier and just told me to send an email if I want. Today 20.06.2024 my sister was in Amsterdam again and went there to ask about my belongings and was told again that nothing was found, they asked again did I sent an email etc, out of this i can only conclude it was stollen by one of waiters or other staff member and they dont want to take responsability for it because with the cameras and exact date and time I gave them they could have found out very easily what happened and where my belongings are!!! Horrible service plus i litterally got robbed there!\n\nBtw the manager tom roorda ignored my email completely and he just writes excuses here cuz he doesnt care if he would this hotel wouldnt be such a let down - just look up all the negative (true/genuine) reviews.",

Daarvan merk ik niets. Het magnifieke hotel in Bangkok met zijn perfectie in service en kwaliteit heeft geen navolging gekregen in Amsterdam. De kamers zijn gedateerd en missen onderhoud. Functieknoppen voor gordijnen en verlichting werken niet of uiterst traag. De bar is sfeerloos, met trage bediening en slechte drankjes. De hotellounge ziet nog wel imposant uit, maar de uitgezakte meubels missen comfort. Ontbijt is duur, maar bediening is slecht. Traag, koude ei-gerechten. Weinig flexibiliteit in bereidingen. Erg standaard dus. Er zijn veel betere hotels in Amsterdam beschikbaar.",

On 12.05.2024 i went there with my sister and friend to have a bday dinner, first of all the staff is rude and not interested at all ,it takes too long to order ,to get the food and drinks and its on a very very very unprofessional and low level all together! Second and worst part was that i left my leather hugo boss backpack with my 500eur tomford sunglasses inside under the table where we were seated , I called the hotel the next day and was told nothing was found! I told them to check the security cameras and find out what happened to my backpack, it was around 7:30pm when we left, they were  not interested just like when I called earlier and just told me to send an email if I want. Today 20.06.2024 my sister was in Amsterdam again and went there to ask about my belongings and was told again that nothing was found, they asked again did I sent an email etc, out of this i can only conclude it was stollen by one of waiters or other staff member and they dont want to take responsability for it because with the cameras and exact date and time I gave them they could have found out very easily what happened and where my belongings are!!! Horrible service plus i litterally got robbed there!\n\nBtw the manager tom roorda ignored my email completely and he just writes excuses here cuz he doesnt care if he would this hotel wouldnt be such a let down - just look up all the negative (true/genuine) reviews.",

There was ketchup on the floor near the head of the bed — clearly left behind by previous guests. I also found a brown stain on the bathrobe that resembled dried blood, and even saw a small bug crawling around.\n\nThese issues clearly indicate that the room was not properly cleaned or inspected before my arrival. I contacted Room Service, and although someone did come to check the situation, the visit ended without any action being taken — and more importantly, the staff member left without closing the door properly. I only realized later that the door had been left open, which is quite unsettling, especially at midnight.\n\nUnfortunately, this experience does not reflect the level of care and attention expected from a hotel of this standard.",

My 1st stay was back in 2022 and it was a good stay. Fast forward to 2025, I thought of checking other hotels options but said better stay in something I tried before. And let me tell you, something has changed in those 3 years and I am not sure what! Was it management, type of training or all, but I assure you, if you stay in this hotel, the stay will be so memorable that you will not even think of checking for other hotel options if you ever comeback again to Amsterdam.\n\nStaff: porters, front desk, concierge, cleaners, they all speak the same language. Not generalizing here, they are all positive and show that they are there to make your stay as easy and happy as possible.  They are so ready to go the extra mile to support and provide services that you may need. Honestly, you feel like part of a community or a family.\n\nRooms: very very clean! No mistakes, no marks, just a very neat and clean room/suite. If you like classic or contemporary design, the rooms have this balance (very rare). Given it is a historic building, yet, equipped with all modern amenities and tools, you will feel a sense of style, class and modernity. Very interesting but works so well for most tastes.\n\nGym and Spa. Haven’t tried the Spa, but I see them fully booked all the time, so means there is something to it.on the other hand, out of my 5 night stay, I went 3 times to the gym and I can tell you, it is almost impossible to get a sizable and well equipped gym in a hotel. This one was well equipped. Push, pull and leg days will be done perfectly. Barbells, dumbbells, raw machine, stepmaster, kettlebells, assault cycle, etc… it is all there. They have a wellness/yoga room with towels and mats positioned in the room so you can just enter and enjoy. Water machine, ready lemon water, and espresso machine. Small lockers for your small items are there as well.\n\nLobby/breakfast: hands down the best French Toast and organic egg you can try in Amsterdam. The service was immaculate. Evenings at the lobby were very relaxing where you can enjoy some quite time or some quality conversations.\n\nLooking for class, style, good feel, excellent service and hospitality, this is the place for you\n\nLooking for loud vibe, crazy atmosphere then this is absolutely not for you\n\nThank you “Conservatorium Team” for a wonderful experience\n\nHabis & Zeinelabdin families",

Cherry on top was the wonderful service staff!\n\nEspecially Sara (or Sarah, sorry didn't get exact spelling) at front desk was very helpful and attentive. It was our first time in Amsterdam, and she offered great advice and we had a nice chat too. We were treated with tea/coffee upon check-in while waiting for our room to be ready (we arrived in the morning so completely understandable).\n\nRoom was clean and beautiful, we didn't take too many pictures but enjoyed as much, if not more. The pool/SPA area was also great and not very crowded either - can be seasonal or just time of the day I imagine.\n\nVan Gogh Museum is across the street and Rijksmuseum is only a couple of blocks away too. You can catch trams 2, 5, 12 and buses in front.\n\nThe only thing I would say is the third day room cleaning. The check-in day was great - clean and tidy; second day was also very detailed and supplies replenished. However, the third day felt a bit rushed: towels not collected, Kleenex not refilled, dirty glasses not collected, no bottled water like previous day, etc.\n\nAll in all, this is what a great hotel (and hotel service) should look like! Not really complaining and would definitely stay again in the future when visiting.",

From the moment you walk in, you feel an overwhelming sense of warmth and elegance—it truly feels like home.\n\nThe hotel itself is breathtaking. Architecturally stunning and perfectly located in the Museum Quarter, it offers easy access to the best of Amsterdam’s culture, art, and charm. But what truly sets it apart is the people. The staff are among the kindest and most genuinely helpful individuals I’ve encountered. Every interaction felt personal and sincere.\n\nWe had a hiccup with our reservation, and Tina was absolutely amazing—so patient and kind while I tried to sort things out with a terrible connection from a moving train. She handled everything with grace and made what could’ve been stressful feel effortless.\n\nTo our delight, the hotel had left special gifts in the room for my kids—a thoughtful touch that meant so much to our family. Their attention to detail is unmatched.\n\nThe food? Extraordinary. Every bite was a delight, whether it was breakfast, room service, or dining in one of their exceptional restaurants.\n\nThis trip was extra special because I brought my children along for the first time. They were in awe and said it was the most beautiful place they’ve ever stayed. That says it all.\n\nIf you’re searching for a place to stay in Amsterdam—look no further. The Conservatorium is not just a hotel, it’s an experience. I honestly wish I had more reasons to travel to Amsterdam, just so I could stay here again. We will absolutely be back.",

Mateo who is the manager of the restaurant took care of our young family each morning, making sure we were taken well care of. To the front desk team, who coordinated special easter hunt activities for our kids in our rooms to even delivering carrots to our rooms because our kids requested them for the bunny rabbit.

I was charged twice 40 days after canceling my membership. I had to file disputes to get them. They didn't even reply to my email.\n\nState of the art library and coworking space!I've taken The Side Hustlers plan which is prefect for after-office studies.\nThe shower, pantry, rooms are all kept clean and filled up frequently.\nYou have access to printing, stationary, snacks, beverages, conference rooms, the hotel's wellness centre, etc. You can bring in guests for meetings too. Highly recommended to try if you want a library or Coworking space that's open 24x7!",

I was not coughing repeatedly; it was one cough that was covered. For £54, you'd expect to eat the granola provided and cough without being accosted. This will be the last time I visit.",
