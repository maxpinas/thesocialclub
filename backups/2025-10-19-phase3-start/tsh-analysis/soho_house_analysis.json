All staff we spoke with were very helpful and friendly, from reception to the bar, and the pool, we never felt like a bother. We stayed during June heatwave so the pool was very busy, if you want to be lazy there on a sunny day (the drinks and food are lovely up there too) I recommend going up early or booking a cabana with the reception team when you check in.

The building itself is beautiful, and the Cowshed spa team continues to deliver excellent quality, but beyond that, the experience has declined.\n\nService is inconsistent at best: staff are often untrained or inattentive, making it unnecessarily difficult to order even a simple drink. Toilets (especially upstairs in summer) are frequently in unacceptable condition, which is disappointing for what is also a hotel. Food quality is a hit-and-miss as well.\n\nMembership value has eroded. There are now large numbers of under-27 members paying half the fee, bringing in several guests and benefiting from extra discounts, which undermines the supposed exclusivity and professional community. Many don’t seem to be in creative industries at all. The “no photo / no call” policy is no longer enforced, so the space feels more like a backdrop for selfies than a members’ club.\n\nI’ve raised these issues with membership managers over the years, they acknowledged service and community challenges, but nothing changed. Ironically, I only received a follow-up call once my membership cancellation had already gone through.\n\nSoho House Berlin still has the potential to be special, but as it stands, the standards have slipped too far. The spa team deserves recognition for maintaining quality, but the rest of the House needs serious attention.",

The most frustrating part wasn’t even the lack of service—it was the sheer chaos. The place was packed to the brim with people on laptops working anywhere they could find space, including standing up at a chest of drawers outside the toilets. Others were pacing around on calls, and some were even taking business calls inside the photo booth. Is this supposed to be a private members’ club or just a crowded Gen Z co-working space?\n\nThe atmosphere was completely lost in the chaos. Finding a comfortable place to sit was impossible unless you arrived ridiculously early, and if you did manage to find a spot, you were wedged between people typing away on laptops or loudly discussing their start-ups. It felt more like a disorganised WeWork than an upmarket social space.\n\nOn top of that, the service was nonexistent. I didn’t see a single waiter the entire time, wasn’t offered a menu, and had to bring my own water and food from outside—at a private club with a hefty membership fee.\n\nThis isn’t a one-off bad experience; it’s clearly a fundamental problem with how the House is being managed. Given that this is the only Soho House in Barcelona, I know of members who are seriously reconsidering whether their membership is even worth it anymore.\n\nUnless something drastically changes, I wouldn’t recommend Soho House Barcelona to anyone looking for an exclusive, stylish, and relaxing place to socialise. Right now, it’s just an expensive, overcrowded mess.\n\nJoin any or all of the London houses if you can, but don’t bother in Barcelona.",

It's over-crowded by 9am all summer and absolutely filthy. They don't clean it on mornings after a busy day so be prepared to swim around in nothing but garbage from the day before.\n\nIf you're a member so that you can attend the events, their booking system is awful. You can never get tickets to anything (even right when they release) and if you turn up to the events you always see the same handful of people inside. It's clearly not a fair allocations system at all, or whoever runs it is just giving access to friends before anyone else.\n\nOverall this place is not worth coming to, let alone the high membership fee associated unless you want to use it for the other houses globally",

We had a Medium room and it was a nice stay (you don’t have a SoHo House membership to stay here). We had a king sized bed and pull out mattress (that’s an extra cost per night). The mini bar is stocked with a lot of liquors and free chocolate chip cookies. The tea set is really cute and the art is aesthetic. There is a restaurant on the rooftop as well as a pool. The gym is well-equipped and they have fitness classes as well. I liked that the bathrooms came supplied with a lot of different options for shampoos, conditioners, and body wash. The location is good and it’s a doable walk to the Centraal Station. ||We did have an issue with some of the staff members not being helpful or blatantly disinterested in helping.  There was a lack of clarity in how many people they allow in hotel rooms (i.e.3 people have to book a medium size room and can’t book a smaller one). The forced upgrade left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth.",

        "text": "Where do I begin? Soho House can be good. This location is beautiful and I think that is the best thing about it: the beautiful building with incredible rooftop views. Unfortunately the place gets full of business guys in business casual attire doing lame business meetings. I heard Soho House was different? I guess not? Whatever.\n\nThe food and drinks here are really good. They have guest chefs and a really solid cocktail menu. Once they even had a special cocktail menu to match the guest chef. Really cool. Coming here for a cocktail on the roof at the end of a night out can be really special and relaxing.\n\nUnfortunately the staff here always hassles you here to order something if you're just sitting and chilling on your phone or computer. Seems like you can't escape someone asking you if you're okay or if you want to eat or drink something. Also related: they pressure you for a tip afterwards. Specifically was asked once with that weird tactic \"what would you like the total to be?\" 🙄  I guess Soho House isn't paying it's staff well enough? Honestly I didn't expect them to even take tips as it's kind of tacky and weird to make your servers fight for tips… just pay them well, it's easy.\n\nIf you're coming here to get some work done, be prepared to eat or drink something. Like, I don't know why this wasn't clear before I became a member, but Soho House is basically just a huge restaurant. Apparently even the designated coworking space in the back is \"a restaurant.\" I once brought some of my own food in to eat while working and was told I couldn't eat while working \"because this is a restaurant.\" Mind you, I'm working in the very back corner of the downstairs area (the area designated for working). Funnily enough, when I visited Soho House Paris, I felt totally comfortable and welcomed by the staff. I didn't even stay at the hotel, and was only coming there to work on a daily basis, and still it was really lovely and the staff made me feel so welcome. But nah, there is no where in Soho House where you can just chill without being constantly bothered to buy something.\n\nA note on the gym: if you're serious about lifting weights, it can often be a struggle to get in a good workout. While the gym area is pretty big, with really nice equipment, it's almost always full. And with only a single bench press, and only a single cable weight machine, I often found myself waiting on someone to be finished. Meanwhile there are like 10 treadmills and 5 peloton bikes, so if you want to do cardio, you're good.",

        "text": "La SoHo House di Amsterdam risiede in un palazzo spettacolare, con vetrate dipinte e un’atmosfera bellissima. La posizione è praticamente perfetta, a due passi da piazza Dam e con vista sui canali questa location non vi deluderà. La vista dal rooftop è in generale da tut te le finestre è veramente bella e caratteristica. Parlando delle stanze: avevo letto molte recensioni che si lamentavano dei rumori quindi prima di prenotare mi sono fatta assicurare di avere una stanza lontana dal club e da tutti i possibili disturbi. La nostra stanza categoria Small numero 42 era silenziosa e con vista sul canale e con abbastanza spazio e luce. Letto comodissimo, abbiamo dormito molto bene. Prodotti bagnoschiuma, pettini, creme in dotazione nella stanza meravigliosi. Aumenterei la luce in bagno. Oppure aggiungerei degli specchi trucco con la luce forte. Durante il soggiorno ho approfittato della palestra (meravigliosa) e del centro massaggi. Vi consiglio di prenotare un massaggio con l’operatore Siwat, non ve ne pentirete. Per quanto riguarda le cose da migliorare: l’area della piscina secondo me necessita di un po’ di lavoro. I letti dove fanno sdraiare gli ospiti non vengono puliti e sistemati tra un’ospite e l’altro quindi non è molto invogliante sdraiarsi in costume vedendo un materasso sfatto e pieno di briciole. Mi è capitato due volte su due. La piscina è molto piccola come nella maggior parte delle SoHo House, ma la vista è molto bella. Un’altra cosa che inizierei a considerare fossi in loro è la possibilità di prevedere una colazione anche piccola da includere per gli ospiti dell’hotel. Farei un refill dei biscottini inclusi ne avevano lasciati solo due e visto che non c è la colazione almeno i biscotti nella postazione potrebbero rimetterli ogni giorno in quantità un po’ maggiori. Il personale è stato gentile e disponibile con noi, niente da dire. Attenzione alle chiavi della vostra stanza: se le perdete vi caricano 250 euro sul conto.",

        "text": "By far the worst Soho House I've been to across the globe. The service is non-existent. I've walked out multiple times after sitting for +15min with no service, or a waiter dropping a menu then never coming back.\n\nIf you're becoming a member or staying here for the pool use, think again. It's over-crowded by 9am all summer and absolutely filthy. They don't clean it on mornings after a busy day so be prepared to swim around in nothing but garbage from the day before.\n\nIf you're a member so that you can attend the events, their booking system is awful. You can never get tickets to anything (even right when they release) and if you turn up to the events you always see the same handful of people inside. It's clearly not a fair allocations system at all, or whoever runs it is just giving access to friends before anyone else.\n\nOverall this place is not worth coming to, let alone the high membership fee associated unless you want to use it for the other houses globally",

Everything else, however, is a masterclass in chaos. The reception is unreliable, the tables in the club look like they haven’t seen a cleaning cloth in weeks, and most of the staff seem to have graduated from the “how to be rude 101” training program. With one shining exception, a single girl who was genuinely helpful, everyone else operates on the level of a budget hostel rather than a so-called five-star establishment.\n\nAnd let’s be clear: laziness cannot be justified by “Soho House values alignment.” It’s not charming, it’s not “community spirit,” and it’s definitely not “cool.” It’s simply unprofessional. That kind of attitude might fly in a place where guests stay for free and staff aren’t being paid, but when I’m paying full price, I expect at least the basics of hospitality.\n\nAt some point, I realized I was doing more work than the staff, and when you politely remind them that service is, in fact, their job, they somehow manage to take offense. Quite an experience.",

I booked Soho House Paris for my one night in the city, expecting the same high standard I remembered from Barcelona — although even there my friend had an issue where her necklace went missing and was only “found” by the cleaning staff after she raised the alarm.\n\nIn Paris, the receptionist was rude and told me I had to pay an unexpected €100 membership fee that wasn’t mentioned at booking. My room was so tiny I could barely move. Late at night, I came back to find a fight at reception between 5–6 men, creating a very unsafe atmosphere.\n\nThe final bill jumped from €265 to €420 without explanation. Only after I complained and mentioned leaving a bad review did they remove the membership fee — yet they still charged me for in-room coffee that any decent hotel includes for free.\n\nFor these prices, you can find far better, safer, and truly high-class hotels in Paris. Definitely not recommended.",
