The restaurant located in the lobby was also fabulous. We had cappuccino every morning from the bar. The rooms were clean and well arranged to accommodate our big American size luggage, ha! We loved the shower. But I think our favorite part of the room was the radio. We listened to it as we got ready every day. Can't forget the vintage photobooth!",

No kindness, no offer of compensation or support, just a \"sorry for the inconvenience\" It is awful to feel like a nuisance when you are paying a considerable amount of money and it has really left a bad taste in my mouth.I would recommend spending your money at one of the many other beautiful hotels in London where you are made to feel like a valued guest,",

The mattress was some sort of springy bed, that sagged and had no proper support.  A hotel on this level should offer a proper bed.  This one should have been thrown out years ago.\n\n#2.  The air conditioner was on, but provided nothing.  There was no cool air and didn’t even move the air.  From entering the first time the room was consistently stuffy with stagnant air.  The windows of room 108 on the first floor couldn’t be opened either. It was always warmer in the room than it was outside. After bringing it to the attention of the front desk, a fan was provided that did help. But the temperature of the room remained warm for our 3 day stay.\n\nOn positive notes, the location is great. The restaurant and lounge is beautiful. Staff was friendly and did what they could to help.\n\nDecided to have breakfast in the lobby restaurant “Lottis” our last morning.  Service was fine, but my salmon benedict had some small grit in the chew.  I removed the sautéed spinach from the 2nd half and there was then no grit.  I suspect the spinach wasn’t properly washed before.\n\nI stayed in 4 other hotels during my Europe trip and The Hoxton was disappointing.  Otherwise Amsterdam was charming but an uncomfortable hotel.",

Overall felt like it was only cleaned superficially and in a rush.\nThe beds are the absolute worst, as you are lying on a board of MDF with a mattress on top, which creaks if you move even a little bit, so not for light sleepers and uncomfortable as well. Water pressure in the shower is really low and since it's one of the newer hotels, you can't open the windows which of course is just my personal preference.\nThe staff was nice and apart from the cleanliness don't think they could do anything to change our experience, but would not come again.",

The mattress was some sort of springy bed, that sagged and had no proper support.  A hotel on this level should offer a proper bed.  This one should have been thrown out years ago.\n\n#2.  The air conditioner was on, but provided nothing.  There was no cool air and didn’t even move the air.  From entering the first time the room was consistently stuffy with stagnant air.  The windows of room 108 on the first floor couldn’t be opened either. It was always warmer in the room than it was outside. After bringing it to the attention of the front desk, a fan was provided that did help. But the temperature of the room remained warm for our 3 day stay.\n\nOn positive notes, the location is great. The restaurant and lounge is beautiful. Staff was friendly and did what they could to help.\n\nDecided to have breakfast in the lobby restaurant “Lottis” our last morning.  Service was fine, but my salmon benedict had some small grit in the chew.  I removed the sautéed spinach from the 2nd half and there was then no grit.  I suspect the spinach wasn’t properly washed before.\n\nI stayed in 4 other hotels during my Europe trip and The Hoxton was disappointing.  Otherwise Amsterdam was charming but an uncomfortable hotel.",

However was really disappointed by the lack of cleanliness of our room. The toilet seat was stained, the shower clearly hasn't received a deep clean in ages. Overall felt like it was only cleaned superficially and in a rush.\nThe beds are the absolute worst, as you are lying on a board of MDF with a mattress on top, which creaks if you move even a little bit, so not for light sleepers and uncomfortable as well. Water pressure in the shower is really low and since it's one of the newer hotels, you can't open the windows which of course is just my personal preference.\nThe staff was nice and apart from the cleanliness don't think they could do anything to change our experience, but would not come again.",

When I asked, they acted like I was bothering them and I had to ask multiple times.\n\nMy teacups were replaced with dirty ones that had a lipstick mark on them.\n\nPlastic cleaning gloves were left in the bathroom sink.\n\nRestaurant staff will leave you sitting there for 30 mins without water. One waiter spilt my coffee all over the table and just walked off and didn’t bother to come back to clean it.\n\nI left my room key at reception for someone to pick up, they lost it before the person even arrived.\n\nWhen I arrived at 7:00am, the day of check-in, there was a man behind the coffee bar on his phone who did not once look up or offer to help me with my luggage. He just listened to me struggle across the cobble stones with two large suitcases.\n\nI know this isn’t a five star establishment but for four stars and 450 euro per night, I’d expect the basics.\n\nI am always polite and friendly, even when asking multiple times for things, so I know they weren’t just ‘sticking it to me’ for having a bad attitude.\n\nTwo of my colleagues stayed at the same time and had similar issues.\n\nSave your money and stay at a boutique hotel where they will provide attentive service.",

Ein absolutes Muss ist das Restaurant „Seabird“ auf der Dachterrasse: mit fast 360-Grad-Blick über London, einer spektakulären Austern- und Seafood-Auswahl sowie spanischen Spezialitäten wie Pimientos de Padrón. Auch die Cocktails sind erstklassig – der Gin Tonic gehört zu den besten, die ich je getrunken habe.||Die Zimmer sind, typisch für London, eher kompakt, dafür aber makellos sauber, stylisch eingerichtet und mit liebevollen Details ausgestattet. Besonders praktisch ist die kleine Musikbox, mit der man Radio hören oder sein iPhone verbinden kann.

Spent the first night in a totally unsuitable room. Were given a drinks ‘voucher’ but told we could not have the drinks we wanted (which would not have cost more than 2 from the prescribed list). After a bit of argument about it (most unpleasant) we left the bar without eating or drinking and went elsewhere for dinner. Having heard nothing further re an explanation or compensation, I chased up an explanation for the booking error. At this stage it was again claimed I had made the mistake and I had to show proof I had not. The manager then blamed the booking agency (Disloyalty) and said any compensation would have to come from them. The issue with the drinks was shrugged off as ‘standard policy’ (we have stayed at this hotel 7 times and previous complimentary drinks were provided without any such issues). To cap it all at checkout I was charged for breakfast bags which on my last 2 visits (they were all booked together) were free. Apparently it was a special offer to drum up trade. At that point I had had enough arguing. My visit was ruined. I spent a good deal of it in the room too stressed out and upset to do all the things we had planned. I won’t be back. I suspect the staff will just be relieved as I presume I was considered a nuisance the whole time.",

My sink had also been clogged or broken but I was told it could not be fixed for at least a day because I had checked in on a Sunday. An associate came to my room to try to help and used the room corkscrew to work on the plumbing — gross!!! Michaela jumped in and moved me to another room (which was much quieter as well, as a huge bonus — not a noisy one overlooking a very loud courtyard.) Thank you!!!\n\nHousekeeping was skipped for the first two days despite my explicit request. (Daily housekeeping is not provided by default.) I also found the room lacked adequate storage, as there was no room for laundry or drawers, forcing me to keep my clothes on the floor.\n\nMy experience in the lobby was also consistently frustrating. Every time I attempted to sit down, I was told to move. I was informed that I couldn't sit in the hotel lobby unless I purchased something, couldn't sit by the window without ordering food, and couldn't sit at a table if I had a laptop. This occurred three days in a row. On one occasion, I ordered a drink and answered emails while I waited. Not permitted! a waitress directed me to a bench behind the reception desk, which was already fully occupied. There is no signage and no explanation of this. You must learn by chastisement.\n\nAdditionally, I was unable to use the hotel's bikes as intended. I was told that bikes could not be kept past 10 PM, making it impossible to bike to dinner. For several consecutive days, when I inquired about a bike, I was told that the six complementary hotel bikes were taken and that I was welcome to go to a hotel-recommended store if I still wanted to rent one.  Of course I can rent one! Dont advertise a free bike program if your advice is to go to another company to spend money. Finally, I was surprised that staff insisted on collecting my borrowed umbrella nightly; the €20 rental hold was apparently not enough for them to be convinced I wasn’t going to steal it overnight. (@hotel: I promised not to steal it... It is in my room right now; please do not go upstairs and take it away from me, I want it for when it's raining later.)\n\nI hope they will address these issues. Michaela at the front desk was extraordinarily helpful with many of the issues I encountered and she is fabulous, going well above and beyond. Truly exceptional!!!!\nUnfortunately one helpful and attentive associate does not completely compensate for feeling thoroughly untrusted and unwelcome. This is not a cheap hostel! My stay was €500 per night! I expected a high quality comfortable stay; if I had known the issues, I would have stayed elsewhere. And bought myself a brand new umbrella every day.",

When I asked, they acted like I was bothering them and I had to ask multiple times.\n\nMy teacups were replaced with dirty ones that had a lipstick mark on them.\n\nPlastic cleaning gloves were left in the bathroom sink.\n\nRestaurant staff will leave you sitting there for 30 mins without water. One waiter spilt my coffee all over the table and just walked off and didn’t bother to come back to clean it.\n\nI left my room key at reception for someone to pick up, they lost it before the person even arrived.\n\nWhen I arrived at 7:00am, the day of check-in, there was a man behind the coffee bar on his phone who did not once look up or offer to help me with my luggage. He just listened to me struggle across the cobble stones with two large suitcases.\n\nI know this isn’t a five star establishment but for four stars and 450 euro per night, I’d expect the basics.\n\nI am always polite and friendly, even when asking multiple times for things, so I know they weren’t just ‘sticking it to me’ for having a bad attitude.\n\nTwo of my colleagues stayed at the same time and had similar issues.\n\nSave your money and stay at a boutique hotel where they will provide attentive service.",

We reserved the largest / most expensive room type in the property (“Biggy”), and were placed in a room on the 21st floor, which is one floor right below the rooftop nightclub which closes at 1am. There was loud dance music, vibrations from the bass, and people shouting that could be heard in our room until 1am, making it impossible to sleep. We were not given the option of having a quieter room when we checked in or when we booked - and the hotel only offered us a new room at 11pm on our final night, when my wife had already gone to bed. Are they running a hotel or a nightclub?\n\n2. We were not told at check-in on Friday night that we need to inform the hotel that we would like our room cleaned on Saturday - so when we returned to our room on Saturday night, we found it completely untouched - not even the bed had been made! The front desk then explained that the Hoxton has a sustainability policy, but I am not sure how not making the bed helps a hotel be more sustainable? We are not asking them to replace the sheets, just merely tidy the room. Might as well have stayed in an Airbnb!\n\n3. On the second night of our stay, we approached the front desk manager with our two complaints above, and he was apologetic - but then proceeded to give us a card with a stock/standard apology written on it about “apologies for the waiting time at check-in; please enjoy two drinks in the meantime” (that wasn’t even one of the issues we experienced!).

If you want a quiet hotel, stay somewhere else or maybe don’t book here on a weekend. It’s conveniently located near the metro (Bonne nouvelle and grand boulevard stations) and walking distance to the louvre, seine, and opera. Breakfast can be included with your room and it’s a proper sit-down breakfast, not buffet, which is great. But service is very slow and the food comes out cold every time.

It was a quick walk to just about everything we wanted to do so no money was wasted on taxis/uber except for the 20 min ride to and from the airport. #2 I would say is the rooms. I felt like I was in my own little apartment. The rooms had tall ceilings, windows that were equally massive providing lots of natural light but also had black out curtains. I was on the first floor with canal views. Despite the winter cold (we went in January) the rooms warmed up and felt very cozy. #3 Was the bar/lounge area which was so comfortable and felt like my living room. I was able to get good drinks and work on my laptop with the other remote workers, and charge everything to my room. One recommendation would be to update Lotti’s lunch/dinner menu. Some heartier comfort meals and go-to classics would have been nice. The wifi was great the entire stay and the staff were friendly. I’d definitely go back.",

Extremely unpleasant communication that ruined our vacation. I checked in at your hotel on the afternoon of the 14th. Initially, I was impressed by the service and design aesthetics. However, my experience took a downturn when I encountered your night reception manager, he told me his name is JC.（sound）\n\nAfter attending a show with my girlfriend, we returned to the hotel at night and realized we had misplaced our room key. We approached the front desk to request a replacement. One of the staff members, a sturdily built male who resembled a bartender (the other was a female), assisted us. He asked for my passport, but I informed him that it was locked in the room. He chuckled and said he had many questions to “interrogate” me with, as he couldn’t just let anyone claiming to have lost their key into a room. I agreed, and he proceeded to ask about my booking details, email, and phone number. I believe I answered four questions correctly. As he was pondering a fifth question, my girlfriend and I suggested that I could provide other identification, such as my driver’s license. He smile and retorted, “Why didn’t you offer that earlier? It would have saved us both some trouble.” I thought to myself, why didn’t he ask if I had other ID? Who is serving whom here? He seemed more suited for interrogations at a police station than hospitality.\n\nDespite his arrogance, we didn’t want to argue, especially since it was Valentine’s Day. We resolved the issue, obtained the new key, and returned to our room.\n\nLater, I encountered another issue: my phone couldn’t connect to the Wi-Fi. I called the front desk for assistance. The staff member advised me to reopen the login page. When I explained that it wasn’t working, he became impatient and insisted I come down so he could handle my phone himself. Valuing my privacy, and having already been unnecessarily questioned about my phone, email, and bank details earlier, I asked if he could guide me through the process over the phone. He responded, “If you come down, I can help you; if not, there’s nothing I can do.” I was taken aback. Having stayed in numerous hotels worldwide, most strive to assist their guests. It’s rare to encounter such unhelpful staff. I calmly asked for his name, and he proudly declared, “I’m JC, the night manager.” I suspect this JC is the same individual who earlier questioned my service professionalism.\n\nI understand everyone has off days, but guests shouldn’t feel they’re being hassled, especially on special occasions when they’ve chosen your hotel for a memorable experience. It’s disappointing. Although a friend recommended your hotel, after this experience, I doubt I’ll return, as the service doesn’t align with the reputation and value I expected.",

A beautifully designed hotel is meaningless if the staff does not prioritise the well-being of its guests.\n\nI cannot, in good conscience, recommend this hotel to anyone, as no guest should have to endure such treatment—especially when reporting a safety concern.\n\n**Rating:** ⭐\n\n---\n\n**Schwerwiegendes Sicherheitsproblem und inakzeptable Reaktion des Personals**\nDas Hotel ist wunderschön gestaltet, mit viel Liebe zum Detail und einer Atmosphäre, die auf den ersten Blick einladend wirkt. Doch leider wurde mein Aufenthalt durch ein gravierendes Sicherheitsproblem und die erschreckende Reaktion des Personals völlig überschattet.\n\nWährend meines Aufenthalts klemmten die Türen des Aufzugs aufgrund eines technischen Defekts mit großer Wucht auf meiner Schulter, was erhebliche Schmerzen verursachte. Als ich den Vorfall der Rezeption und später dem Manager meldete, war die Reaktion schockierend gleichgültig. Der Manager weigerte sich kategorisch, die Überwachungskameraaufnahmen zu prüfen, und begegnete meinen Bedenken mit Unglauben und Respektlosigkeit.\n\nEs ist schlichtweg inakzeptabel, dass ein Hotel, das so viel in Ästhetik und das Gästeerlebnis investiert, bei grundlegenden Sicherheitsmaßnahmen und professionellem Verhalten derart versagt. Ein schönes Design ist bedeutungslos, wenn das Personal nicht die Sicherheit und das Wohlbefinden der Gäste an erste Stelle setzt.\n\nIch kann dieses Hotel nicht empfehlen, denn kein Gast sollte so behandelt werden—insbesondere nicht, wenn er ein Sicherheitsproblem meldet.\n\n**Bewertung:** ⭐",
