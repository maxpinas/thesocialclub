When I asked why I hadn’t been informed, I was told that since I had booked through Amex Fine Resorts, they didn’t have my contact details. Yet both the spa and the restaurant had been booked in advance and confirmed to my personal email address. I also have a “Fans of MO” account, and Google could easily have helped.||For a Mandarin Oriental, where rates start at €900 per night, this was more than just a disappointment — it was a wasted Sunday.",

        "text": "A Truly Exceptional Hotel – My Favorite in the World\n\nI’ve traveled to many countries and stayed in countless hotels, but the Conservatorium Hotel in Amsterdam stands out as my absolute favorite. From the moment you walk in, you feel an overwhelming sense of warmth and elegance—it truly feels like home.\n\nThe hotel itself is breathtaking. Architecturally stunning and perfectly located in the Museum Quarter, it offers easy access to the best of Amsterdam’s culture, art, and charm. But what truly sets it apart is the people. The staff are among the kindest and most genuinely helpful individuals I’ve encountered. Every interaction felt personal and sincere.\n\nWe had a hiccup with our reservation, and Tina was absolutely amazing—so patient and kind while I tried to sort things out with a terrible connection from a moving train. She handled everything with grace and made what could’ve been stressful feel effortless.\n\nTo our delight, the hotel had left special gifts in the room for my kids—a thoughtful touch that meant so much to our family. Their attention to detail is unmatched.\n\nThe food? Extraordinary. Every bite was a delight, whether it was breakfast, room service, or dining in one of their exceptional restaurants.\n\nThis trip was extra special because I brought my children along for the first time. They were in awe and said it was the most beautiful place they’ve ever stayed. That says it all.\n\nIf you’re searching for a place to stay in Amsterdam—look no further. The Conservatorium is not just a hotel, it’s an experience. I honestly wish I had more reasons to travel to Amsterdam, just so I could stay here again. We will absolutely be back.",

From the moment you walk in, the hotel impresses with a beautiful glass ceiling that floods the space with natural light.\n\nThe service was impeccable. Every staff member we encountered was warm, kind, and genuinely welcoming. We stayed in a top-floor room that featured three skylights, including one in the bathroom, which added such a magical touch. The bed was incredibly comfortable, making it hard to leave in the morning!\n\nThe location is perfect! It’s just steps away from luxury boutiques and about a 15-minute walk to a vibrant neighborhood where we discovered the delicious Fabel Friet.\n\nHighly recommend this hotel for a luxurious and memorable stay in Amsterdam.",

The staff were friendly, helpful and made us feel like family with their hospitality.\n\nBreakfast was incredible with a fantastic vegetarian selection. Concierge is helpful for helping plan the day and they have a great selection of bikes available to rent including one with a child seat.\n\nThe location is superb - especially for families. There are multiple amazing places to relax between the spa and the lobby. Finally - the building itself is an architectural masterpiece which makes you never want to leave.\n\nThank you for a very memorable trip.",

Within walking distance to all prominent museums (Rijkmuseum, Van Gogh Museum, Stedelijk Museum, Moco museum) and right behind the luxury shopping street of Pieter Cornelisz Hooftstraat. We visited during winter so the Christmas market is also within walking distance. We had the duplex room which has an amazing ambience, high ceiling and very comfortable. However be warned that you have to climb up and down the stairs to get from the bed to the living room/wardrobe/toilet, which we kind of regretted after the second day of our stay. Otherwise the hotel also features a very nice spa and gym, as well as a few luxury shops in the building. The lounge area is very popular with non hotel guests as well. Service is exceptional. Our arrival flight was early, way before check in time, but they let us use the spa shower facilities to freshen up. Both concierge and front office staff are very helpful and friendly too. Will definitely stay again.",

There was ketchup on the floor near the head of the bed — clearly left behind by previous guests. I also found a brown stain on the bathrobe that resembled dried blood, and even saw a small bug crawling around.\n\nThese issues clearly indicate that the room was not properly cleaned or inspected before my arrival. I contacted Room Service, and although someone did come to check the situation, the visit ended without any action being taken — and more importantly, the staff member left without closing the door properly. I only realized later that the door had been left open, which is quite unsettling, especially at midnight.\n\nUnfortunately, this experience does not reflect the level of care and attention expected from a hotel of this standard.",

In my opinion I waited too long for a waiter to get to my table and she couldn't make a smile when she got there. The cocktail was alright. I ordered a cheese platter, which was the most boring platter I ever had, and I didn't get any explanation about the cheeses on the board. It also took forever for anypne tp come and check on mu table. At home, I realised I paid 40 EURO for a cocktail and a cheese platter, which seems way too expensive even for a place like this. But since I didn't ask for a receipt, I don't know if everything was charged correctly, so I have to let that one go. The ambience is very nice, though, and toilets are very clean, but I expected way more of a place like this.",

My 1st stay was back in 2022 and it was a good stay. Fast forward to 2025, I thought of checking other hotels options but said better stay in something I tried before. And let me tell you, something has changed in those 3 years and I am not sure what! Was it management, type of training or all, but I assure you, if you stay in this hotel, the stay will be so memorable that you will not even think of checking for other hotel options if you ever comeback again to Amsterdam.\n\nStaff: porters, front desk, concierge, cleaners, they all speak the same language. Not generalizing here, they are all positive and show that they are there to make your stay as easy and happy as possible.  They are so ready to go the extra mile to support and provide services that you may need. Honestly, you feel like part of a community or a family.\n\nRooms: very very clean! No mistakes, no marks, just a very neat and clean room/suite. If you like classic or contemporary design, the rooms have this balance (very rare). Given it is a historic building, yet, equipped with all modern amenities and tools, you will feel a sense of style, class and modernity. Very interesting but works so well for most tastes.\n\nGym and Spa. Haven’t tried the Spa, but I see them fully booked all the time, so means there is something to it.on the other hand, out of my 5 night stay, I went 3 times to the gym and I can tell you, it is almost impossible to get a sizable and well equipped gym in a hotel. This one was well equipped. Push, pull and leg days will be done perfectly. Barbells, dumbbells, raw machine, stepmaster, kettlebells, assault cycle, etc… it is all there. They have a wellness/yoga room with towels and mats positioned in the room so you can just enter and enjoy. Water machine, ready lemon water, and espresso machine. Small lockers for your small items are there as well.\n\nLobby/breakfast: hands down the best French Toast and organic egg you can try in Amsterdam. The service was immaculate. Evenings at the lobby were very relaxing where you can enjoy some quite time or some quality conversations.\n\nLooking for class, style, good feel, excellent service and hospitality, this is the place for you\n\nLooking for loud vibe, crazy atmosphere then this is absolutely not for you\n\nThank you “Conservatorium Team” for a wonderful experience\n\nHabis & Zeinelabdin families",

Cherry on top was the wonderful service staff!\n\nEspecially Sara (or Sarah, sorry didn't get exact spelling) at front desk was very helpful and attentive. It was our first time in Amsterdam, and she offered great advice and we had a nice chat too. We were treated with tea/coffee upon check-in while waiting for our room to be ready (we arrived in the morning so completely understandable).\n\nRoom was clean and beautiful, we didn't take too many pictures but enjoyed as much, if not more. The pool/SPA area was also great and not very crowded either - can be seasonal or just time of the day I imagine.\n\nVan Gogh Museum is across the street and Rijksmuseum is only a couple of blocks away too. You can catch trams 2, 5, 12 and buses in front.\n\nThe only thing I would say is the third day room cleaning. The check-in day was great - clean and tidy; second day was also very detailed and supplies replenished. However, the third day felt a bit rushed: towels not collected, Kleenex not refilled, dirty glasses not collected, no bottled water like previous day, etc.\n\nAll in all, this is what a great hotel (and hotel service) should look like! Not really complaining and would definitely stay again in the future when visiting.",

        "text": "A Truly Exceptional Hotel – My Favorite in the World\n\nI’ve traveled to many countries and stayed in countless hotels, but the Conservatorium Hotel in Amsterdam stands out as my absolute favorite. From the moment you walk in, you feel an overwhelming sense of warmth and elegance—it truly feels like home.\n\nThe hotel itself is breathtaking. Architecturally stunning and perfectly located in the Museum Quarter, it offers easy access to the best of Amsterdam’s culture, art, and charm. But what truly sets it apart is the people. The staff are among the kindest and most genuinely helpful individuals I’ve encountered. Every interaction felt personal and sincere.\n\nWe had a hiccup with our reservation, and Tina was absolutely amazing—so patient and kind while I tried to sort things out with a terrible connection from a moving train. She handled everything with grace and made what could’ve been stressful feel effortless.\n\nTo our delight, the hotel had left special gifts in the room for my kids—a thoughtful touch that meant so much to our family. Their attention to detail is unmatched.\n\nThe food? Extraordinary. Every bite was a delight, whether it was breakfast, room service, or dining in one of their exceptional restaurants.\n\nThis trip was extra special because I brought my children along for the first time. They were in awe and said it was the most beautiful place they’ve ever stayed. That says it all.\n\nIf you’re searching for a place to stay in Amsterdam—look no further. The Conservatorium is not just a hotel, it’s an experience. I honestly wish I had more reasons to travel to Amsterdam, just so I could stay here again. We will absolutely be back.",

Besides the amazing location, amenities and luxurious rooms, what blew us away was the staff in every single department that was so keen on providing attention to detail. Starting with exceptional bell service team who greeted us at the front of the hotel each and everyday, they always engaged with our young children making jokes and making them feel so welcome. Mateo who is the manager of the restaurant took care of our young family each morning, making sure we were taken well care of. To the front desk team, who coordinated special easter hunt activities for our kids in our rooms to even delivering carrots to our rooms because our kids requested them for the bunny rabbit. All to say, its the emotional connection that they made w our family that made this stay exceptional and above and beyond. Thank you to the entire team at Conservatorium hotel.",
