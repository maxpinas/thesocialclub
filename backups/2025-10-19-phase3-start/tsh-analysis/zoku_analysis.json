Oddly, the rooms have been designed around the concept of holding business meetings and the bed is viewed as something secondary/less important. The designer thought it more important to give their guests a giant table and hide the bed in an elevated cage. Fine, if you are a “young, single entrepreneur” who loves the nostalgia of childhood bunk beds and dens, not so great when you’re a middle aged couple, on their holiday. The chore of climbing over your sleeping other half to use the bathroom, highlighted how this room was designed on novelty, rather than function. The pointless gymnasium rings hanging from the ceiling supported this attraction to playful novelty.\n\nDo be aware of the constant hum of an air filtration system, with an extra vent inside your bed cage.\n\nWe did ask if we could change rooms, to a more conventional room with a bed accessible from both sides, but we were told they were designed for customers with disabilities and all were currently occupied.\n\nThe roof top reception lounge and restaurant is a great space, but this is taken over with people working and team meetings, so not somewhere you would be comfortable being, while on holiday. The breakfast is excellent, with good healthy options. The location is close to the metro station and university. 30 minutes walk into town.\n\nIf you value sleep and comfort, over team meetings, Zoku is not for you. It is not a great sign, when you look forward to going home, so you can finally get a good nights sleep.\n\nIf we visited Copenhagen again, we would stay more central, in a hotel that placed the bed as the most important part of the room.",

I had stayed here before, and at their property in Amsterdam a few years ago, and was always impressed with the properties - and why I rebooked here. I forgot there was a safe in the room  - so part of this issue is on me. I told reception about the money missing late Friday afternoon, and the kind staff person was apologetic and said he’d contact the manager to respond. About an hour later I checked in again, and was told the manager was reviewing video and would connect with me. No one followed up. I checked out this morning and still no response from the hotel. I appreciate the convenient location of the hotel, and the quality of the rooms, but I can’t stay here again if I’m left with any suspicion about theft; and the lack of response from management.\n\nMay 16 - Several folks contacted me wondering if there was any resolution.\n\nI contacted the hotel, as they suggested, but there was no response. I contacted them again about a week later, and they replied, and a phone call was arranged.\n\nI was up front about my mistake re: the safe, and acknowledging I agreed to the terms of their agreement when making a reservation which talks about lost/stolen property.\n\nThey admitted mishandling communication with me - in particular not contacting me between the time I reported the money missing on Friday afternoon until I checked out on Monday morning. They admitted they should have immediately offered to move me to a different room. They admitted they should have offered to assist me in making a complaint to the police. They said the hotel terminated the employment of the staff who was in my room from housekeeping. They apologized for the poor communication and their other mistakes.\n\nThey offered to give me a 15 percent discount on the cost of a future stay at any Zoku hotel, along with dinner and drinks. While I've enjoyed previous stays with them I don't consider that to be much of an incentive to trust the brand again.\n\nThey assured me actions have been put in place to ensure the situation doesn't happen again.",

I had to show my reservation to resolve this.\n\nIncorrect Charges: They tried to overcharge me by €150, claiming a \"rate change,\" but corrected it after I showed proof of payment.\n\nForced Upgrade Fee: When extending, I was told only larger rooms were available and had to pay an extra €40.\n\nNo Late Check-Out Flexibility: After 6 nights, they refused a 1-hour late check-out without a €25 fee.\n\nAdditional Concerns:\n\nDisappointing cleanliness standards—linens, kitchen utensils, and towels had an unpleasant smell.\n\nThe couch in Room 520 had a strong odor, making it unusable.\n\nWhile staff were young and friendly, their empathy often felt forced or insincere (except for Rod at reception, who was genuinely welcoming).\n\nDespite these frustrations, I love Zoku’s unique loft concept and will give them another chance, hoping for better consistency next time.",

I love how they have a chef cooking eggs in the morning for breakfast and sometimes the coffee taste really nice at the coffee machine.\n\nCons: However, when we first arrive, we got a bit confused, we can't tell that the rooftop is a lobby to check-in, a place to sit and relax/work or a cafe/bar? Appearently it's all in one 😅 there's a time I brought my own pastries to eat while waiting to collect my lugguage from the locker room, one of the staff rudely just went \"you can't eat outside food here\". If You have an integrated cafe/lobby/resting/working area all together, where was I suppose to sit and munch on my small pastry while I check out? The staff should have told me politely to not have something outside here or ask me if I want to buy a drink because I wanted to buy a coffee but no one attended to me so I grab a glass of water instead. Also, not alot of choices of food during breakfast, lunch and dinner. Although the Live music on Saturday night was good, it was too loud, I hardly can have a proper conversation while we sit, drink tea and relax cause we can't hear one another.\n\nWill I recommend this place to stay?

On the positive side, the rooms are set up more like small serviced apartments, which is very convenient for longer stays. Having your own kitchen and a separate seating area adds a level of comfort and independence that standard hotel rooms often lack.\n\nAnother highlight is the rooftop terrace — beautifully decorated and offering a lovely view over Amsterdam. It’s a great spot to relax, and it's also accessible to non-hotel guests!\n\nHowever, the price point does not match the overall quality and experience. First of all, cleanliness is a real issue. While you can request cleaning, it is done very superficially. Stains and dust remain. This gives the entire place a neglected feel.\n\nBut the biggest disappointment was the overall environment. We had expected a more peaceful, community-oriented atmosphere with other long-term residents such as expats or professionals. Instead, the building feels more like a student dorm. Hallways are often messy, trash is left around, there’s a persistent smell of weed in the elevators and common areas, and noise at night is constant — with people slamming doors and shouting in the hallways, waking us up multiple times.\n\nWhile the hotel markets itself as a long-term living solution or community, it doesn’t live up to that promise. If you’re looking for a quiet, comfortable, and well-maintained place to stay for a longer period in Amsterdam, I would recommend looking into Airbnb options, renting an apartment, or spending a little more for a proper hotel experience. Unfortunately, this property falls short on many fronts — and for the price, it simply isn’t worth it for a longer period.\n\nSide note: Long-term guests only receive one free laundry cycle during their stay, which seems rather limited and not particularly guest-friendly. Additionally, we were left without coffee cups in our room for over two weeks due to “ordering issues” — small things, but they add up during a longer stay.",

On the positive side, the rooms are set up more like small serviced apartments, which is very convenient for longer stays. Having your own kitchen and a separate seating area adds a level of comfort and independence that standard hotel rooms often lack.\n\nAnother highlight is the rooftop terrace — beautifully decorated and offering a lovely view over Amsterdam. It’s a great spot to relax, and it's also accessible to non-hotel guests!\n\nHowever, the price point does not match the overall quality and experience. First of all, cleanliness is a real issue. While you can request cleaning, it is done very superficially. Stains and dust remain. This gives the entire place a neglected feel.\n\nBut the biggest disappointment was the overall environment. We had expected a more peaceful, community-oriented atmosphere with other long-term residents such as expats or professionals. Instead, the building feels more like a student dorm. Hallways are often messy, trash is left around, there’s a persistent smell of weed in the elevators and common areas, and noise at night is constant — with people slamming doors and shouting in the hallways, waking us up multiple times.\n\nWhile the hotel markets itself as a long-term living solution or community, it doesn’t live up to that promise. If you’re looking for a quiet, comfortable, and well-maintained place to stay for a longer period in Amsterdam, I would recommend looking into Airbnb options, renting an apartment, or spending a little more for a proper hotel experience. Unfortunately, this property falls short on many fronts — and for the price, it simply isn’t worth it for a longer period.\n\nSide note: Long-term guests only receive one free laundry cycle during their stay, which seems rather limited and not particularly guest-friendly. Additionally, we were left without coffee cups in our room for over two weeks due to “ordering issues” — small things, but they add up during a longer stay.",

The hotel is great both as a base to discover the city, or as a place to stay for some remote work.\n\nRooms: The interior design and setup of the lofts is absolutely genius (and calling them \"rooms\" wouldn't do them justice). It really does feel like your own cozy apartment in the city, with every appliance (including dishwasher) and every little accessory you can think of. The beds are very comfy, too. Every floor also has a (free) pantry with additional items to stock up your room.\n\nRooftop bar: The. View. Is. Gorgeous. Very solid drinks, too. And so many different seating areas: Tables to work at, couches to lounge in, bars to mingle at, tables to dine... The outdoor areas are great too, including several cute little more private areas on one side. The bar is also a great lounge-like space all day to get work done\n\nLocation: Very central, and super easy to reach with the subway.\n\nService: Absolutely outstanding. Everyone is super friendly and helpful. In interactions, I get the impression that the staff really enjoys working here. There was a (very, very minor!) issue with the stove vent in my room. I mentioned it, and was offered to be moved to a different room without even asking.\n\nAre there cheaper options to stay in Amsterdam? Yes. Are there better options to stay in Amsterdam?

Similar to another review I’ve read here, Zoku housekeeping “could not find” an item I left in the room. This is extremely hard to believe given it’s at least $2000 euros in value and regardless of the value, the standard hotel policy is to hold onto a lost & found item for 90 days. I reported this missing item 4 days after my stay and it took them another 5 days with barely any correspondence in between to plainly tell me that housekeeping did not find it - not a single apology for even taking so long to reply. As others have also mentioned here, it’s likely the case that this item was discarded or stolen, both outcomes I deem very shocking for a hotel like this in Copenhagen.\n\nThe housekeeping staff in general is extremely rude and before this incident was disappointing. We were not informed during check in that we have to tidy our own rooms using the pantry on each floor, so we asked one of the housekeeping staff if we could just please have new towels. Instead of directing us to the pantry or handing us some towels from her cart, she literally scoffed at us that “it’s not possible” so we had to go all the way to the lobby to ask how we can get any towels or cleaning.",

Oddly, the rooms have been designed around the concept of holding business meetings and the bed is viewed as something secondary/less important. The designer thought it more important to give their guests a giant table and hide the bed in an elevated cage. Fine, if you are a “young, single entrepreneur” who loves the nostalgia of childhood bunk beds and dens, not so great when you’re a middle aged couple, on their holiday. The chore of climbing over your sleeping other half to use the bathroom, highlighted how this room was designed on novelty, rather than function. The pointless gymnasium rings hanging from the ceiling supported this attraction to playful novelty.\n\nDo be aware of the constant hum of an air filtration system, with an extra vent inside your bed cage.\n\nWe did ask if we could change rooms, to a more conventional room with a bed accessible from both sides, but we were told they were designed for customers with disabilities and all were currently occupied.\n\nThe roof top reception lounge and restaurant is a great space, but this is taken over with people working and team meetings, so not somewhere you would be comfortable being, while on holiday. The breakfast is excellent, with good healthy options. The location is close to the metro station and university. 30 minutes walk into town.\n\nIf you value sleep and comfort, over team meetings, Zoku is not for you. It is not a great sign, when you look forward to going home, so you can finally get a good nights sleep.\n\nIf we visited Copenhagen again, we would stay more central, in a hotel that placed the bed as the most important part of the room.",

It was honestly disgusting and set the tone for the rest of the stay.\n\nI had already read another review about someone developing a rash from mislabelled toiletries, and unfortunately, I had a similar experience. I found a bottle labeled as body lotion, but it was clearly filled with body wash or shampoo. Completely unacceptable and honestly dangerous. This points to a pattern of negligence.\n\nIt’s clear the housekeeping team is understaffed or poorly trained—probably both. They’re not keeping up, and it shows.\n\nTo top it all off, the fire alarm went off in the middle of the night and blared for over 10 minutes, waking up the entire hotel. No explanation, no apology, just more chaos.\n\nThis hotel could be amazing—the design is cool and modern, and the idea behind it has potential. But it’s totally undermined by terrible management and lack of proper staffing.

I had stayed here before, and at their property in Amsterdam a few years ago, and was always impressed with the properties - and why I rebooked here. I forgot there was a safe in the room  - so part of this issue is on me. I told reception about the money missing late Friday afternoon, and the kind staff person was apologetic and said he’d contact the manager to respond. About an hour later I checked in again, and was told the manager was reviewing video and would connect with me. No one followed up. I checked out this morning and still no response from the hotel. I appreciate the convenient location of the hotel, and the quality of the rooms, but I can’t stay here again if I’m left with any suspicion about theft; and the lack of response from management.\n\nMay 16 - Several folks contacted me wondering if there was any resolution.\n\nI contacted the hotel, as they suggested, but there was no response. I contacted them again about a week later, and they replied, and a phone call was arranged.\n\nI was up front about my mistake re: the safe, and acknowledging I agreed to the terms of their agreement when making a reservation which talks about lost/stolen property.\n\nThey admitted mishandling communication with me - in particular not contacting me between the time I reported the money missing on Friday afternoon until I checked out on Monday morning. They admitted they should have immediately offered to move me to a different room. They admitted they should have offered to assist me in making a complaint to the police. They said the hotel terminated the employment of the staff who was in my room from housekeeping. They apologized for the poor communication and their other mistakes.\n\nThey offered to give me a 15 percent discount on the cost of a future stay at any Zoku hotel, along with dinner and drinks. While I've enjoyed previous stays with them I don't consider that to be much of an incentive to trust the brand again.\n\nThey assured me actions have been put in place to ensure the situation doesn't happen again.",

Stayed in a loft XL and the bed took me back to building a fort as a kid.., it was so so cool.. And super comfy bed.. The staff are super friendly and helpful.. The place is clean and tidy and modern and has great chill spots on the 6th floor as you walk through to the bar/food/chill/living area.. Location is beautiful and offers some good views locally and there are metro and tram stops very close by that get you anywhere you need.. As well as the views there are some nice spots to eat close by.. Again...., wonderful stay here at Zoku... Thank you again guys.. ❤️",

When we had issues with the AC malfunctioning, the front desk did nothing to fix it and it took repeated calls to get it addressed. As a result, we spent 2 nights tossing and turning in an overheated room before the problem was fixed.  Location is in a business park that’s far from central Copenhagen and there are very few restaurants or places to see within walking distance. Lots of road noise\n\nConclusion: Not recommended",

        "text": "A space designed for young entrepreneurs. Oddly, the rooms have been designed around the concept of holding business meetings and the bed is viewed as something secondary/less important. The designer thought it more important to give their guests a giant table and hide the bed in an elevated cage. Fine, if you are a “young, single entrepreneur” who loves the nostalgia of childhood bunk beds and dens, not so great when you’re a middle aged couple, on their holiday. The chore of climbing over your sleeping other half to use the bathroom, highlighted how this room was designed on novelty, rather than function. The pointless gymnasium rings hanging from the ceiling supported this attraction to playful novelty.\n\nDo be aware of the constant hum of an air filtration system, with an extra vent inside your bed cage.\n\nWe did ask if we could change rooms, to a more conventional room with a bed accessible from both sides, but we were told they were designed for customers with disabilities and all were currently occupied.\n\nThe roof top reception lounge and restaurant is a great space, but this is taken over with people working and team meetings, so not somewhere you would be comfortable being, while on holiday. The breakfast is excellent, with good healthy options. The location is close to the metro station and university. 30 minutes walk into town.\n\nIf you value sleep and comfort, over team meetings, Zoku is not for you. It is not a great sign, when you look forward to going home, so you can finally get a good nights sleep.\n\nIf we visited Copenhagen again, we would stay more central, in a hotel that placed the bed as the most important part of the room.",

Trotzdem wurde meiner Kollegin der Fika extra berechnet, obwohl dieser im Day Pass enthalten sein sollte. Zusätzlich wurden uns 2 weitere Day Passes verrechnet, obwohl unsere Freundinnen erst ab 14:00 Uhr kamen und nur vom Brunch-Menü bestellt haben.\n\nÜberraschend wurde heute auch der Seminarraum berechnet, obwohl dieser in der Vergangenheit nie extra verrechnet wurde (am 15. Juni wurde uns sogar ein Seminar ohne Aufpreis angeboten).\n\nBesonders unangenehm war, dass wir uns rechtfertigen mussten, weil eine Kellnerin falsche Annahmen getroffen hat – anstatt einfach nachzufragen. Das wirkte unprofessionell und war mir gegenüber meiner Kollegin peinlich, die ich kurzzeitig wegen eines Notfalls alleine lassen musste.\n\nAm Ende wurde die Rechnung zwar auf 34 € korrigiert (statt über 100 €), dennoch war die Situation unnötig stressig und unangenehm. Wir haben Zoku bisher gerne auch unseren Studenten zum Lernen empfohlen, werden aber künftig überlegen, ob wir Meetings noch hier abhalten.\n\nSehr schade – bisher war Zoku für mich immer ein Ort mit entspannter und transparenter Atmosphäre.

This hotel ranks as one of the top.  And it’s not because it’s some kind of big fancy posh hotel. Yes it is absolutely beautiful and the rooms have everything that you need - very spacious and adorable, down to the loft bed and the cute little touches like inspirational quotes on the wall and hanging exercise rings.  But there’s also just a feel that you get here that you don’t get everywhere. The staff are so down to earth and friendly and you can tell they really enjoy their jobs and their coworkers.  The food is also top notch. That chef really knows how to cook an egg perfectly - and it is an art.  When we had a boat ride one morning, they went out of their way to bring us towels and to-go boxes to pack up our breakfast for the morning. Everyone there is always smiling and in a good mood and ready to serve. It’s also really nice to have a hotel that has laundry services available when you are traveling for a long time.  There are also special relaxing places all over the hotel that most hotels do not have. It’s done in a really cozy way with swings and indoor plants and hammocks and unique touches all over the hotel that are kind of hard to describe until you get there. One example is sticky notes that guests can leave on one wall that explain what makes them smile. You kind of have to see it to understand but it feels more like a family there than just a hotel stay.  The other thing that’s really nice is the hotel is in a very quiet and peaceful part of town that is just a two minute walk to the metro and then just three stops on the metro to the main part of town, so the location is just ideal! I would stay here over and over again and obviously recommend it to anyone.",

As a digital nomad, I’ve bounced around dozens of coliving/workspaces, but Zoku is on another level. It’s rare to find a place that gets both living and working right, but somehow, Zoku nails both with style, thoughtfulness, and a good dose of fun.||The Loft: My home base was one of their Lofts — brilliantly designed with everything I needed to live and work comfortably. The modular layout is genius: a cozy bed tucked away, a proper desk with a comfortable chair and great lighting, and even a small kitchen. It felt like a little apartment, not just a hotel room. Everything is sleek, functional, and well thought through.||The Workspaces: What really sets Zoku apart is the coworking setup. I’d start my day with a fresh coffee on the rooftop terrace, then settle into the communal work area upstairs. Super fast Wi-Fi, plenty of outlets, natural light, and a vibe that somehow balances productivity with creativity. I met fellow remote workers and entrepreneurs from all over the world. It’s a built-in community that doesn’t feel forced.||One Friday night, I stumbled into a live music evening on the terrace which was magical. It’s one of the few places I’ve stayed where I felt genuinely connected rather than just passing through.||Location: Being based in Paris 17th was ideal. Quiet enough to get work done, but a quick metro ride away from all the buzz of central Paris. And Zoku itself feels like a calm oasis — creative, inspiring, and totally welcoming.||In short, Zoku Paris is the kind of place you plan to stay for a week… and end up extending for a month. If you’re a digital nomad looking for a place to work, live, and actually thrive in Paris — this is it!!",
