(Video attached)\n\nThe design is smart, space-efficient, and everything from the bed to the bathroom setup feels sleek and modern. 🛏️🚿\n\nOne of the coolest features is the mood lighting, you can actually change the colors while you shower, which makes it feel a bit trippy and fun. Definitely adds to the experience .\n\nOverall, it’s not a traditional hotel vibe, but if you’re into modern design and clever tech touches, it’s a memorable place to stay.\n\nRatings:\n🛏️ Room Comfort & Design: 4.5/5\n🛎 Service & Ambience: 4/5\n💸 Money’s Worth: 4/5\n\nTip: Don’t miss playing around with the shower lighting; it’s part of the fun!",

And the price was lower than I thought, so I had to ask my friends in Rotterdam if this is a hostel room or no.\nwhen I made the reservation, I wrote a comment for requesting a view for Oude Haven. I did not even know if they read it but when I arrived to my room, I understood they read it! And I asked this after checkout if they read it, they said yes and they specially gave me that room. Thanks for that again.\nMy room was super useful. Small room but have all what I need for this stay! and I loved how you adapted technology to hotel room. I was able to control everything with the tablet near of my bed, even air conditioner & curtains!\nI did not had much things to talk with staff but whenever I had to talk them, they were super friendly & helpful.\nif I ever come to Rotterdam again, I will definitely stay in this hotel.\nand a little tip to football fans. if you are coming to Rotterdam for a football game against Feyenoord, Oude Haven is the meeting point for away fans before the game. and this hotel is located just in there. so, you can't find a better place than this.\nthanks again.",

They bought a hot chocolate. I came back and joined them, and was told it cost 29.99Euros to sit there, I said it was only for 15 minutes whilst they finished their call. The worker said fine and said I needed to buy something. I mean, fine, I asked them for a hot chocolate but was told, clearly, they don't do waiter service. So I went and bought another hot chocolate, gave it to my colleague and waited in the bar area, I was told I had to be if I didn't pay the 29.99working rate for the office. Fine.||My colleague came back and the person came to talk to us and I said \"I'll take a beer and another hot chocolate\". I was then informed because my colleague had been there, for an hour they must pay 29.99Europs now otherwise they can't buy food or drink. I said, \"Just so I get this, I can only buy them a drink, if they pay 29.99 but I can buy something for myself ?\", yes was the reply.||They will literally REFUSE to take your money, unless you pay a 29.99 fee first. They told me it was because it was prioritising their guests who wanted to use the facilities. It was empty, loads of empty tables there.||I'd heard of \"bar fines\" in the go-go bars of Thailand where you have to pay money to the owner if you take a worker home, but I'd never heard of being charged to buy drinks in the West. Didn't realise it was THAT sort of bar....||I've stayed in the Savoy, The Ritz, The Shard, fortunate to stay in the world';s top hotels but never come across this.

They bought a hot chocolate. I came back and joined them, and was told it cost 29.99Euros to sit there, I said it was only for 15 minutes whilst they finished their call. The worker said fine and said I needed to buy something. I mean, fine, I asked them for a hot chocolate but was told, clearly, they don't do waiter service. So I went and bought another hot chocolate, gave it to my colleague and waited in the bar area, I was told I had to be if I didn't pay the 29.99working rate for the office. Fine.||My colleague came back and the person came to talk to us and I said \"I'll take a beer and another hot chocolate\". I was then informed because my colleague had been there, for an hour they must pay 29.99Europs now otherwise they can't buy food or drink. I said, \"Just so I get this, I can only buy them a drink, if they pay 29.99 but I can buy something for myself ?\", yes was the reply.||They will literally REFUSE to take your money, unless you pay a 29.99 fee first. They told me it was because it was prioritising their guests who wanted to use the facilities. It was empty, loads of empty tables there.||I'd heard of \"bar fines\" in the go-go bars of Thailand where you have to pay money to the owner if you take a worker home, but I'd never heard of being charged to buy drinks in the West. Didn't realise it was THAT sort of bar....||I've stayed in the Savoy, The Ritz, The Shard, fortunate to stay in the world';s top hotels but never come across this.

I stayed in a room facing the inner garden which was quiet enough to get some good sleep. The morning autumnal walk to RAI across the park was pleasant, especially since it wasn't raining.

Let me break down my 5-day stay experience:\n\nThe good: Superior room automation (everything controlled via tablet), excellent WiFi connectivity, convenient location for business travelers, and handy luggage lockers. The building has Lime bicycle stations right outside, and the vibrant nightlife across the street is a plus.\n\nThe bad: The room design is bizarrely impractical with a sink placed awkwardly in the sleeping area, and rooms are surprisingly smaller than budget hotels like Travelodge. The £20 breakfast feels overpriced for the limited variety offered.\n\nThe ugly: The elevator situation is an absolute nightmare - 80% of the time they're out of service, forcing guests to wait endlessly or use stairs. Staff seemed indifferent to these issues. Rooms facing the metro line suffer from significant noise intrusion, though internal soundproofing is decent.\n\nWhile the location is prime for Shoreditch exploration and business trips, the consistent elevator problems, basic amenities, and cramped rooms make it hard to justify the premium pricing. You're essentially paying for the trendy brand name rather than superior comfort or service.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

I came back just to write this review because I got reminded of how traumatic my stay was. The room felt like living in a coffin - it was that tiny and stuffy. They provide ZERO room service in a 4 star hotel which is just ridiculous actually even low star hotels have room service someone needs to rebuke their stars or the hotel brand needs to go out of business. I would never stay here of my own accord I only stayed there because I was forced to by my job. I was staying there in winter and they don’t provide any adequate bedding or pillows, don’t allow deliveries to the room which is ridiculous because then why don’t your staff just deliver it?? Also the thermostat is always broken. They don’t provide enough towels you always have to request everything - even a simple room cleaning. it doesn’t feel like staying in a hotel it feels like your staying at a place where you are unwelcome. The people who created this hotel should really take a course on hospitality or learn something from the east where even lower star hotels provide good hospitality. The whole place is cheaply done. The lights are glitchy. I wish they would just go out of business. The sinks are smaller than airplane sinks water just gets all over your place. Even apartments in nyc are bigger than these rooms",

Non mi piace lasciare recensioni negative, ma ci sono stati alcuni fattori che hanno reso la permanenza poco piacevole.\nPRO:\n1. letto king size con topper comodissimo\n2. Posizione comoda per spostarsi sia in treno verso l’aeroporto e altre città, sia verso il centro con il tram che ferma praticamente davanti\n3. Ambassador sempre disponibili e pronti ad aiutarti\nCONTRO:\n1. La stanza era freddissima. Abbiamo chiesto di alzarci la temperatura, aspettato che si aggiornasse il sistema, ma in camera si moriva di freddo. Si potrebbe pensare di far andare il clima solo per qualche ora dalle 11 alle 15 e lasciare agli ospiti la scelta di accenderlo o meno anche di notte. Così è insopportabile. Non vedevamo l’ora di uscire.\n2. Le pulizie totalmente da rivedere. Al check-in ore 15.30 la stanza non era ancora pronta, nei giorni seguenti le pulizie venivano fatte nel tardo pomeriggio quando rientravamo. Un giorno non ci hanno messo la carta igienica, poi mancavano gli asciugamani e un altro giorno proprio non le hanno fatte anche se erano state richieste.\n3. Il bagno così allestito con wc e doccia divisi in due sorte di cilindri sono molto scomodi. Anche la zona per riporre le cose è poco pratica rispetto ad altri hotel della stessa catena. Il primo CitizenM in cui ho trovato un phon scarso!",

        "text": "A high tech hotel in the heart of a trendy neighborhood, the citizenM hotel Shoreditch was an ideal place for a couple visiting London for the first time. Shoreditch is on the West and North side of London. Close to the downtown area, Shoreditch was within walking distance to tube stations and buses. Liverpool Street station is not far from the hotel and from there you can go anywhere in the city. We walked down the A-10 to the OXO building and had a reservation for the Sky Garden at OXO. The number 8 bus stop is about a block away from the hotel outside the Shoreditch High Street station making it easy to navigate to St. Paul's Cathedral or along the Thames River. Our room had a king size bed with a beautiful shower and a small/narrow sink and makeup table. There is an iPad next to the bed to control the lights, temperature, and television. You can order room service or visit the 24-hour lounge on the second floor behind the reception area. One night after coming back to the hotel after 10 PM we ordered a plate of nachos and ate in a quiet corner of the restaurant. You can pre-order breakfast for £13 per person (£16 same morning) or take a short walk across the courtyard to a coffee shop. There are two restaurants also located just outside the hotel and lots of small pubs and places to eat close by. CitizenM was a convenient place to stay in London for sightseers and those who want an upscale, tech hotel for a good price.",

        "text": "The citizenM Hotel is about a 10-minute walk from Liverpool Street and well connected to all major stations. Reception is on the first floor with a self-check-in system, which unfortunately didn’t work for us. The rooms and the hotel overall are very clean and well maintained. There is only one type of room: for two people with a toilet and shower. With lots of luggage, the room feels cramped, but it’s manageable. The shower and toilet are only separated by frosted glass. The entire room can be controlled by tablet, and a safe is provided. Despite the noisy surroundings, the hotel itself is very quiet and pleasant. The windows cannot be opened. Free Wi-Fi is available and worked well. The service was excellent: staff were always friendly and helpful. Requests like an extra blanket or towels were immediately fulfilled. The hotel bar is nice, offers a wide selection of drinks, and is open 24/7. We even received complimentary black tea. For two rooms and four nights, we paid over £1000 (without breakfast), which is acceptable for London given the location.\nSummary: Clean, friendly, and well-maintained hotel with small rooms at a high but fair price.\n\nOrginal German:\nDas citizenM Hotel ist etwa 10 Gehminuten von der Liverpool Street entfernt und gut von allen großen Bahnhöfen erreichbar. Die Rezeption befindet sich im 1. Stock, wo ein Self-Check-in möglich ist, der bei uns jedoch nicht funktioniert hat. Die Zimmer und das gesamte Hotel sind sehr sauber und ordentlich. Es gibt nur einen einzigen Zimmertyp: ein Raum für zwei Personen mit Toilette und Dusche. Mit viel Gepäck wird es schnell eng, es ist aber machbar. Die Dusche und Toilette sind nur durch Milchglas vom restlichen Raum getrennt. Das gesamte Zimmer kann über ein Tablet gesteuert werden, ein Tresor steht ebenfalls zur Verfügung. Trotz der lauten Umgebung ist es im Hotel sehr ruhig und angenehm. Die Fenster lassen sich allerdings nicht öffnen. Kostenloses WLAN ist vorhanden und hat stets funktioniert. Der Service ist ausgezeichnet: Alle Mitarbeiter waren freundlich und ansprechbar. Wünsche wie eine zusätzliche Decke oder Handtücher wurden sofort erfüllt. Die Hotelbar ist nett, bietet eine große Getränkeauswahl und das rund um die Uhr. Wir bekamen sogar kostenlos schwarzen Tee. Für zwei Zimmer und vier Nächte haben wir über 1000 £ (ohne Frühstück) bezahlt, was für die Lage und London insgesamt in Ordnung ist.\nZusammenfassung: Sauberes, freundliches und ordentliches Hotel mit relativ kleinen Zimmern zu einem zwar teuren, aber dennoch fairen Preis.",

        "text": "Really Good! Stayed here in February 2025 as a couple. The staff were awesome, really friendly and welcoming. The rooms were really good, trendy décor, good size, functional layout, clean, bed was massive, the room was control via a tablet and the shower was good. Staff and food/Drink are available all night as well. The communal areas are great as well. It has included WiFi throughout the place/rooms.\nUnfortunately, when we tried to use the smart TV in the room, it did not work. The staff offered a room move but we had unpacked, it was late and we could not be bothered. So when you get in the room, check the TV before you settle in. They did offer us other compliantly offers. They do not have their own car park, so you have to sort out your own parking if you drive. Really good place to stay!",

The public living room area is pretty big, well designed, plenty of sockets and fast WiFi.\n\nLocation wise this is in the middle of Shoreditch, Liverpool St is about a 10-15 minutes walk away. Plenty of eating, drinking and entertainment options nearby",
