# Persona methodology

Comprehensive documentation of how target personas were developed for The Social Hub's 4-star transformation and membership model strategy, based on cross-brand analysis of 8 hospitality brands.

**Research date:** October 18, 2025  
**Brands analyzed:** 8 (The Social Hub, The Hoxton, CitizenM, Mama Shelter, Soho House, Zoku, Working From_, Conservatorium Hotel)  
**Total sample size:** 10,000+ reviews and comments across all platforms  
**Methodology:** Cross-brand validation with minimum 3 brands per persona

---

## Executive summary

Five core personas were identified through systematic analysis of customer sentiment, demographics, and behaviors across 8 hospitality brands. These personas represent the target audience for a 4-star hotel with membership model in Europe. Each persona was validated across multiple brands (minimum 3) to ensure robustness and avoid over-fitting to any single brand's customer base.

The personas are prioritized based on their fit with The Social Hub's transformation goals, with tier 2 brands (The Hoxton, CitizenM, Mama Shelter) and tier 3 brands (Zoku, Working From_) serving as primary benchmarks, as these represent the aspirational positioning TSH aims to achieve.

## Methodology overview

### Data collection approach

**Phase 1: Multi-brand sentiment research**
- Parallel data collection across 8 brands and 8 platforms
- Platforms: TripAdvisor, Booking.com, Google Reviews, Reddit, Instagram, X/Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn
- Time period: Post-pandemic (2022-2025, preferably 2024-2025)
- Total data points: 55 successful research subtasks

**Phase 2: Cross-brand analysis**
- Extracted demographics, psychographics, use cases, happiness drivers, and frustrations from each brand
- Identified recurring patterns across multiple brands
- Validated persona characteristics with minimum 3 brand appearances
- Quantified persona distribution based on review mention patterns

**Phase 3: Persona synthesis**
- Clustered similar audience segments into coherent personas
- Prioritized personas based on frequency and strategic fit
- Documented evidence from multiple brands for each persona
- Calculated willingness-to-pay based on pricing sensitivity data

### Brand weighting for persona development

**Tier 1 (Primary benchmarks):**
- **Tier 2 brands:** The Hoxton, CitizenM, Mama Shelter (40% weight)
  - Rationale: 4-star lifestyle hotels with membership models, TSH's direct aspirational peers
  
- **Tier 3 brands:** Zoku, Working From_ (30% weight)
  - Rationale: Hybrid hotel/co-working models, innovative amenity integration

**Tier 2 (Secondary benchmarks):**
- **Soho House** (15% weight)
  - Rationale: Premium membership club, represents upper bound of pricing and exclusivity
  
- **The Social Hub** (10% weight)
  - Rationale: Current state validation, but not aspirational benchmark (still in transformation)

**Tier 3 (Context only):**
- **Conservatorium Hotel** (5% weight)
  - Rationale: Luxury 5-star, provides context but not target positioning

This weighting ensures personas are based on TSH's aspirational positioning (4-star with membership), not their current state (student accommodation transitioning to 4-star).

   - Strong validation in tier 2/3 brands

4. **Hybrid Worker:** 10-15% of members

1. **Local Professional** (30-35%)
2. **Digital Nomad** (20-25%)
3. **Business Traveler** (20-25%)

**Rationale:**
- Combined 70-85% of membership base

- Align with TSH's existing strengths (co-working, multi-city presence, social atmosphere)
- Proven willingness to pay (€400-1,000/year range)

**Phase 2 (Expansion):** Add remaining personas

## Limitations and recommendations

### Limitations identified

1. **TSH current state bias:**
   - TSH data heavily skewed toward students (current state)
   - Mitigated by weighting tier 2/3 brands (40% + 30% = 70% of persona development)
   - Recommendation: Validate personas with TSH pilot program data

2. **Willingness-to-pay estimates:**
   - No direct survey data on WTP for TSH membership
   - Estimated from competitor pricing and value perception
   - Recommendation: Test pricing tiers (€450, €500, €600) in pilot

3. **Regional variations:**
   - Limited data on persona distribution by country
   - Northern Europe may skew toward Local Professional
   - Southern Europe may skew toward Digital Nomad
   - Recommendation: Track regional differences in pilot program

4. **Wellness enthusiast validation:**
   - Only 4/8 brands show strong evidence
   - May be premium segment (Conservatorium, Soho House)
   - Recommendation: Validate demand before major wellness investment

5. **Sample size variations:**
   - Some brands have 10x more reviews than others
   - CitizenM (n=6,395) vs. Working From_ (limited data)
   - Mitigated by cross-brand validation requirement

### Recommendations for validation

**Phase 1: Pre-launch validation**
1. Survey current TSH guests (n=500+) on:
   - Willingness to pay for membership
   - Desired amenities
   - Usage frequency estimates
   - Persona self-identification

2. Conduct focus groups (n=5-8 per persona) to:
   - Validate persona characteristics
   - Test messaging and positioning
   - Understand decision-making process

**Phase 2: Pilot program validation**
1. Track actual membership distribution by persona
2. Monitor amenity usage patterns by persona
3. Measure satisfaction and retention by persona
4. Adjust pricing and benefits based on data

**Phase 3: Ongoing optimization**
1. Quarterly persona review based on new data
2. Annual persona refresh to capture market shifts
3. A/B test messaging for different personas
4. Refine amenity mix based on usage patterns

**Business Traveler (TSH Club €600/year):**

## Conclusion

Five core personas were identified through systematic cross-brand analysis of 8 hospitality brands, representing 10,000+ reviews and comments. Each persona was validated across minimum 3 brands to ensure robustness and avoid over-fitting to any single brand's customer base.

The personas prioritize tier 2 (The Hoxton, CitizenM, Mama Shelter) and tier 3 (Zoku, Working From_) brands as primary benchmarks, as these represent The Social Hub's aspirational 4-star positioning with membership model.

**Key findings:**

1. **Business Traveler** is the most universal persona (8/8 brand validation)
2. **Local Professional** has highest estimated market share (30-35%)
3. **Digital Nomad** benefits most from TSH's multi-city advantage
4. **Wellness Enthusiast** requires significant amenity investment (validate demand first)
5. **Hybrid Worker** is a growing post-pandemic segment

**Recommended approach:**

**Phase 1:** Focus on top 3 personas (Local Professional, Digital Nomad, Business Traveler) representing 70-85% of membership base

**Phase 2:** Add Hybrid Worker and Wellness Enthusiast once core membership is established

**Pricing:** Two-tier model (TSH+ €99-120, TSH Club €450-600) to serve different personas and WTP ranges

**Validation:** Pilot program to test personas, pricing, and amenity usage before full rollout

This persona framework provides a data-driven foundation for The Social Hub's 4-star transformation and membership model strategy, grounded in real customer behaviors and preferences across the competitive landscape.
