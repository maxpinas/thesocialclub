## Limitations and Considerations

### Google Maps Limitations

1. **Self-Selection Bias:** Guests who leave Google Maps reviews may differ from those who don't (though this applies to all platforms)
2. **Recency Bias:** More recent experiences may be overrepresented
3. **Location Variance:** Some locations have more reviews than others, potentially skewing brand-level insights
4. **Limited Membership Insights:** Membership-specific feedback rare in Google Maps (guests focus on hotel stay, not membership value)
5. **Pricing Discussions:** Less detailed pricing debate compared to Reddit or Booking.com

### Multi-Platform Research Limitations

1. **Smaller Sample Size:** 580 reviews vs. 5,969 (Google Maps)
2. **Platform Access Issues:** Many platforms require login (Reddit, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X), limiting data collection
3. **Inconsistent Coverage:** Some brands have more multi-platform data than others
4. **Manual Extraction:** More prone to sampling bias and incomplete coverage

### Mitigation Strategies

✅ **Triangulation:** Use both sources to cross-validate insights
✅ **Weighted Analysis:** Prioritize Google Maps for quantitative themes, multi-platform for qualitative depth
✅ **Transparency:** Clearly cite source and sample size for all claims (e.g., "n=252 from Google Maps, n=14 from Reddit")
✅ **Continuous Validation:** Periodically re-validate Google Maps insights against new multi-platform data

---

## Recommendations for Data Usage

### For Quantitative Analysis (Theme Prevalence, Sentiment Distribution)

**Primary Source:** Google Maps
- **Rationale:** Large sample size (5,969 reviews) provides statistical robustness
- **Use Cases:** "Service quality mentioned by 25% of reviewers (n=252)", "72.9% positive sentiment"

### For Qualitative Insights (Membership Value, Pricing Debates, Community Vibe)

**Primary Source:** Multi-Platform Research
- **Rationale:** Platforms like Reddit and Instagram capture nuanced discussions not present in Google Maps
- **Use Cases:** "Reddit users debate Soho House membership value", "Instagram highlights design aesthetics"

### For Strategic Recommendations

**Combined Approach:**
- Use Google Maps to identify **what** themes matter (quantitative)
- Use multi-platform research to understand **why** they matter (qualitative)
- **Example:** Google Maps shows "service" mentioned 520 times for The Hoxton → Multi-platform research reveals it's the "friendly, attentive staff" and "personalized touches" that drive satisfaction
