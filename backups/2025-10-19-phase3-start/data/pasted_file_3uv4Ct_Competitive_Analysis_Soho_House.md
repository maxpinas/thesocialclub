# Soho House Competitive Analysis

## 1. Brand overview (portfolio, ownership, positioning, history)

Soho House, founded in 1995 by Nick Jones, originated from a Georgian townhouse in London's Greek Street, situated above his restaurant, Cafe Boheme. The brand's logo symbolically represents the three interconnecting floors of this initial establishment. Over the years, Soho House has evolved into a global membership platform, providing diverse physical and digital spaces designed for creatives to connect and foster a sense of belonging worldwide. Each House is meticulously crafted to offer a unique yet familiar experience, featuring areas for dining, relaxation, work, and exercise, alongside amenities like screening rooms and rooftop pools. A significant aspect of the Soho House identity is its extensive art collection, comprising over 8,000 curated works that are integral to the design of every location.

Beyond its core club offerings, Soho House has diversified its portfolio to include Cowshed spas, which began at Babington House in 1998 and are now found in larger outposts globally. The brand also operates Cecconi's, an Italian restaurant concept that originated in London's Mayfair in 2005 and has since expanded internationally. Many Soho House locations offer hotel bedrooms, distinguished by signature features such as freestanding baths, Hypnos mattresses, treat tins, and minibars. In 2016, Soho Home was launched, an interiors range inspired by the aesthetic of the Houses, allowing members to purchase furniture, artwork, and lighting. Soho Works, introduced in 2015, provides co-working spaces in major cities like London, New York, and Los Angeles. The "Cities Without Houses" membership, launched in 2018, extends the community to members who do not reside near a physical House, offering access to local creative networks and Houses during travel.

Recent expansions highlight the brand's continued growth, with new Houses opening in 2024 in Sao Paulo, Portland, London (Soho Mews House), and Miami (Miami Pool House). Further expansion is planned for 2025 with Soho Farmhouse Ibiza. Andrew Carnie assumed the role of CEO of Soho House & Co in 2022.

### Ownership and Recent Developments

In August 2025, Soho House & Co Inc. announced a definitive take-private agreement. A consortium led by MCR Hotels, the third-largest hotel group in the U.S., and including investors like Ashton Kutcher, acquired Soho House & Co.'s outstanding shares for $9.00 each in cash. Executive Chairman Ron Burkle and The Yucaipa Companies LLC, along with other major shareholders, will roll over their controlling equity interests, retaining significant influence over the business. This move marks Soho House's return to private ownership after its stock experienced a 45% drop, reflecting a strategic shift to navigate challenges related to scaling its exclusivity proposition.

## 2. Unique positioning (what makes them different)

Soho House distinguishes itself as a members-only club specifically tailored for individuals in the creative industries. Its unique positioning is built upon fostering a curated sense of community and exclusivity, providing a global network of physical and digital spaces where like-minded professionals can connect, collaborate, and socialize. The brand's commitment to artistic expression, evident in its extensive art collection and interior design, further sets it apart from traditional hospitality or social clubs. The 

focus on fostering a community for creatives, rather than just providing luxury amenities, is a key differentiator. The recent move to go private again, after a period of public ownership, highlights a strategic effort to reinforce its exclusive image and address challenges associated with scaling while maintaining its core value proposition.
