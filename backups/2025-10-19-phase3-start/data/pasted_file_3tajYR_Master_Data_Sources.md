## Limitations and gaps

### Data gaps identified

**1. Willingness-to-pay data**
- No direct survey of TSH customers
- Pricing sensitivity inferred from reviews
- Recommendation: Conduct pilot survey

**2. Actual amenity usage data**
- No access to TSH's internal usage metrics
- Gym, pool, co-working usage estimated from industry studies
- Recommendation: Analyze TSH's internal data

**3. Membership conversion rates**
- No data on hotel guest → member conversion
- Estimated from competitor benchmarks
- Recommendation: Track during pilot program

**4. Regional pricing variations**
- Limited data on why Glasgow membership is 30% more expensive than Italy
- Operating cost differences not quantified
- Recommendation: Conduct regional cost analysis

**5. TikTok coverage**
- Insufficient content found for most brands
- Gen Z perspective underrepresented
- Limitation: Platform may not be primary channel for this segment yet

**6. Direct competitor interviews**
- No primary research with competitor members
- All data is secondary (reviews, social media)
- Recommendation: Conduct member interviews for deeper insights

### Methodological limitations

**1. Platform access restrictions**
- Some platforms blocked by security measures
- Proxy data used (e.g., Booking.com instead of Instagram)
- Impact: May miss platform-specific sentiment

**2. Date filtering challenges**
- Google Reviews uses relative dates ("a month ago")
- Difficult to ensure strict 2024-2025 filter
- Mitigation: Focused on most recent reviews

**3. Sample size variations**
- Some brands have limited online presence (Working From_, Conservatorium)
- Sample sizes vary from n=10 to n=6,000+
- Mitigation: Confidence scores reflect sample size

**4. Self-selection bias**
- People who leave reviews may not represent average customer
- Extreme experiences (very good/very bad) overrepresented
- Mitigation: Large sample sizes help balance this

**5. Language barriers**
- Some European reviews in local languages
- Translation may miss nuances
- Mitigation: Focused on English-language platforms and reviews
