## Membership Model Analysis

### Multi-Platform Supplementary Insight (n=250 reviews)

2. **Networking and community** with creative professionals
3. **Under-27 discounts** (50% off food/drinks, reduced membership fees)
4. **Access to club spaces, bedrooms, spas, gyms, screening rooms, events**

### Strategic Insight for TSH Dis-Loyalty Program

**Learn from Soho House's Strengths:**
- Global network creates value (reciprocal access)

- Under-27 discount attracts young professionals

**Avoid Soho House's Weaknesses:**

## Pricing & Value Perception Analysis

### Google Maps Data (n=937 reviews)

**Positive Mentions:** 21 (2.2% of all reviews)

**Negative Mentions:** 11 (1.2% of all reviews)

**Net Sentiment:** +10 (slightly positive)

### Multi-Platform Insights

Pricing is a major discussion point on Reddit and social media:

**Membership Fees:**
- Debated frequently
- Some find value, others question cost
- Under-27 discount seen as good value
- Annual fees create commitment barrier

**Hotel Room Pricing:**
- Premium pricing (€200-400/night)
- Not competitive with budget/mid-range hotels
- Justified by amenities and member access

**F&B Pricing:**
- Expensive, even for members
- Quality justifies pricing for some
- Others find it overpriced

**Strategic Insight:** Soho House is premium-priced and unapologetic about it. TSH operates in a different segment (affordable style) and should not try to match Soho House's luxury positioning. Instead, TSH should offer "accessible community and amenities" at 1/10th the membership cost.
