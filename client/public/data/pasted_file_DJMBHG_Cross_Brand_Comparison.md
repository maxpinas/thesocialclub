### Key Quotes
> Positive: 'You have everything you need (fully furnished room, equipped kitchen, access to the gym, common rooms, study room, restaurant).' (2 years ago)
Negative: 'Soo I stayed in the one in Rotterdam and overall it was a shit show. Actually half of the year the heating wasnt working then during a heat wave, the air conditioner stopped working The wifi stopped working for a week And the staff’s communication sometimes just sucks.' (2 years ago)

> "Great stay at The Social Hub Lovely, clean, comfortable rooms. Fantastic, friendly, helpful staff. We only had breakfast there one day but the food was excellent with an amazing variety which we found very good value. Easy access to the centre by tram or metro. The rooms were a little too warm but that is often the case in hotels." (Reviewed: October 17, 2025)

> Positive: "Lovelly service, the staff on the reception were very pleasant and welcoming. Everything was clean and functioned. The shower was awesome and I feel …" (Trip.com Member, a month ago)
Negative: "WARNING Stay away from this place. I made a booking on August 4, 2025, for the period August 19, 2025, to September 2, 2025. The amount they charged was significantly …" (Anton, a month ago)

> Positive: "You have everything you need (fully furnished room, equipped kitchen, access to the gym, common rooms, study room, restaurant)" [Source 1]. "If you can afford it, you can rent a room in 3 mins, you get a lot of benefits and for first year students the social hub is where most make their friends." [Source 3]. Negative: "Diabolical prices at the social hub in Rotterdam" [Source 2]. "I’m currently staying here and it’s dirty and their AC barely works, I personally don’t like it and am looking to leave." [Source 4]. "Holy shit their shitty ass rooms are 1.3k????? I am paying 1250 inclusive service costs for a 70m2 new build 2019 apartment next to a park and a decent hood" [Source 4].

> Positive: "The vibrant atmosphere and young people running this place has a very low treshold that makes it easy and comfortable to stay and enjoy your time. Great shower and body products to indulge yourself, while water and coffee is available in the room. You have everything you need ; like a small fridge not loaded (luckily no silly minibar). Great airco and Wifi. The perfect stay to visit Madrid!" (July 2025, Madrid)
Negative: "Room didn't have a safe. This is a strange choice to be left out since the room was otherwise well equipped with fridge and coffeemaker. Food (and drinks) were not of great value in the rooftop restaurant as the quality didn't match the price. Also at the breakfast, hot items were lukewarm at best and it's the first time in a hotel that I decided not to eat the eggs again after tasting them. Hotel staff is young and based on my interactions with them, perhaps somewhat inexperienced in hospitality industry." (July 2025, Madrid)

> Positive: "Lovely, clean, comfortable rooms. Fantastic, friendly, helpful staff. We only had breakfast there one day but the food was excellent with an amazing variety which we found very good value. Easy access to the centre by tram or metro." (Margaret, UK, October 2025) 

Negative: "Not really for my age group (40+). It's like a college campus in the reception, and the room is like a dorm room. Great if you're younger, I guess. Slightly rough outside where the parking is. Had to walk past some drunk guys, one who was relieving himself in a hedgerow and another who yelled at me as I walked past. Not the fault of the hotel, obviously, but a consideration for some travellers." (Samantha, UK, September 2025)

Wish List/Suggestion: "It would have been better if there was one connected double bed instead of 2 singles." (Scott, UK, October 2025)

> Positive: "I absolutely enjoyed my stay at the Social Hub! Incredibly entertaining with many options to enjoy your stay at the hotel. The rooftop is breathtaking with gorgeous views of the city. I would definitely return!!" - Jacqueline (Expedia, Oct 1, 2025). Negative: "I was at the social center in Barcelona for business in June. Breakfast was included in the price of the room but they took another €25 from my credit card and they still haven't credited it back." - Vi Be (Facebook, Aug 28, 2024).

(Review by Megan from Australia, October 6, 2025); 'The rooms are extremely small We booked the "Cozy" size and there was barely room to open our suitcases.' (Review by Annie from United States, October 1, 2025)

> Positive: "if you want great service, this is the place to stay." (Matthew Bowers, Oct 2025). "The location is excellent, the rooms are a decent size, and everything was kept clean and tidy." (André Nesheim, Sept 2025). "From the chic interiors to the vibrant atmosphere, everything about the hotel exudes charm and comfort. But what truly elevated my experience was the exceptional service at ..." (Ameri Mohammad zakria, Oct 2025).
Negative: "I’ve been staying at the Hoxton, on and off, since 2012 and, I’m sorry to say that it’s lost its mojo. While the recent room improvements are appreciated, other changes disappoint." (Buck Smith, Oct 2025). "Our experience at The Hoxton Shoreditch was so misleading and disruptive that I feel other travellers should be aware." (Kyle G, Oct 2025).

> Positive: "I would highly recommend The Hoxton in the 2nd (Sentier.) It's in a great location on the right bank that is walkable to just about everything you want to do. It also caters to a younger crowd and has a bustling and great lobby with multiple restaurants, bars and a coffee shop. The hotel is very aesthetically pleasing, rooms are very comfortable, and prices are good. I've stayed many times." (u/One_Walrus_809, Feb 2025)
Negative: "Hoxton is generally nice. I’ve stayed a few times. But I’m wrapping up a stay there which was pretty bad due to noise. Don’t let them put you in a room by the elevator, or you’ll hear it all night. Lots of drunks roaming the halls, and the plumbing has issues." (u/Hot-Freedom-1044, Jan 2025)
Negative: "When I signed up in August 2025 it was monthly rolling, but when I went to cancel month-to-month they began claiming the monthly rate is actually a yearly contract. The website now says "Dis-loyalty is a 1-year minimum commitment"." (u/and_what_army, Aug 2025)

> Positive: "Incredibly stylish hotel in a completely updated former factory building. Very popular bar and restaurant in lobby. Rooms were elegant and thoughtfully ..."

> Positive: "What The Hoxton does deliver on is (as the yoofs say!) the vibes." (Rhys Jones); Positive: "Seabird is very trendy, and for good reason: the setting is stunning, particularly on the balmy summer evening we had, with a beautiful outdoor terrace looking towards the One Blackfriars tower and the river."; Negative: "Let’s be clear about what The Hoxton Southwark has to offer, because it isn’t going to be for everyone. The small rooms are unsuitable for anyone with lots of luggage or families – if that’s you, then somewhere else may be better."; Negative: "That said, prices can be punchy: even the smallest Shoebox rooms vary from £200 to over £400, depending on the night."

> Positive: "One thing that immediately attracted me to the Hoxton was the ability to choose your own check in and check out time. Coming from the US and arriving very early in the day this was very important to me to maximize our time in Amsterdam." Negative: "The cosy room was certainly that… And I do realize that a lot of hotel rooms in renovated Canal houses, etc. in Europe in general are smaller than a newly built chain. I expected that. However, there have to be minimum functionalities available in order for a room to be accommodating. This room did not have any place to place a piece of luggage and open it."

### Key Quotes

Very friendly and helpful staff.' (Sep 14, 2025). Negative: 'The rooms were tiny. I literally had to climb over my husband. No nightstand or place to put anything. No glasses - not even a paper cup. The shower was tiny and uncomfortable. Everything was electronic and a royal pain ! Never again!!!' (Sep 12, 2025)

> Positive: Perfect room for 2 people -- would 100% stay there again and recommend it., We had a great stay! Loved the location and the vibe!. Negative: the only thing i didn't like was that there was no free drip coffee., the bathroom areas was part of the room worn fuzzy glass and a curtain for privacy.

> Positive: Had a great stay here while visiting in Feb 2024. The location was absolutely perfect. The hotel itself is modern, cool and nicely decorated. More (Source: Justin Perry, Local Guide · 68 reviews · 11 photos, Date: 5/5 2 days ago on Google NEW)
Negative: This was perfect if you are coming into Penn station to see a broadway show. Rooms are small but clean and safe. More (Source: Odara Lozano, Local Guide · 43 reviews · 376 photos, Date: 5/5 3 days ago on Google NEW)

> Positive: "The app also lets you control the lighting, AC, TV, and 2 stage blinds in the room. The room is small but smart, with one of the nicest 10sqft showers you’ll ever take and a really great bed and sheet/pillow set. Always sparkling clean." (Source: Reddit, u/krogerceo, ~April 2025)
Negative: "The hotels do not make clear that when you sign up for mycitizenM, you are signing up for a year. And you get charged every month. I do not recall seeing that the membership had a mandatory one-year 'membership,' so they make a lot of money on what seems to me a slightly deceptive practice." (Source: Reddit, u/KarlaV98, ~January 2025)
Negative: "I’m heartbroken by this acquisition. I give them less than 12 months before everything that made them great is dumbed down and ruined." (Source: Reddit, u/alexwasinmadison, ~July 2025)

> Positive: "I like this hotel! If you’re really into tech you’ll truly like this place. The lobby is colorful, upbeat and high tech. Check-in area is sort of like an Apple Store.

No glasses - not even a paper cup. The shower was tiny and uncomfortable. Everything was electronic and a royal pain ! Never again!!!" - Catherine Roy, Sep 12, 2025. Negative: "Today, they tried to take $120 from my account as a renewal. I find this incredibly sneaky. There was no warning that I would be charged unless I took action. It just feels really dishonest, especially as my initial upgrade was unsolicited. I likely won't use them again after this" - Kev Harrison, Jul 29, 2025.

> Positive: "Everything, especially the beds and the communal spaces. The staff are exceptional - helpful and welcoming always." - Heather, United Kingdom, August 2025. Positive: "I like the design of the hotel. It’s very interesting and unique. It’s like a pop-art museum. I like that a room was very high-tech with iPad controlling everything, free streaming tv, daylight and night curtains." - Nikita, United States, September 2025. Negative: "The Hotel's location is a short walk to the nearby Metro Subway Station and Grand Market, which was very helpful. However, the neighborhood itself was distressed and blighted with broken down buildings and homelessness. Once inside the hotel, you are fine, but getting to it, especially in the evenings, was an unpleasant and often times disturbing experience." - Carl, United States, September 2025. Negative: "This location particularly being Downtown LA was a little scary at times. Walking around the city, do be more cautious of your surroundings. They do not offer parking, we had to do some research on where to park our car that was safe and offered overnight parking. We did have to walk a tad in the streets of LA from the parking garage to the hotel. So that was my only downfall was parking was a bit stressful for us." - Jessica, United States, September 2025.

Negative: "I’ve reported the matter to both, and to Google, for review. If you seek a night’s rest, look elsewhere. But if you wish to undertake an endurance trial worthy of the Fellowship — complete with extreme heat, odor, and empty promises — then by all means, CitizenM Bankside awaits." – Ben Palka, Aug 14, 2025.

### Key Quotes
> Positive: "This is my second stay at Mama Shelter London, and I have to say I absolutely love everything about it. From the warmth and friendliness of the team at the front desk and the restaurant to the comfort of the rooms and the thoughtful little details. The location couldn't be better - it's right in the heart of East London which is perfect for a solo traveller like me who loves exploring the city on foot or hopping on the Tube." (Chaitanya, October 18, 2025)
Negative: "Disappointed with the noise level from the street and the bar downstairs. Made it difficult to sleep. Room was okay, but nothing special for the price. Location is good if you want to be in a lively area, but not for a quiet stay." (Olivia P., September 22, 2025)

The dinner at the restaurant and the breakfast are perfect with quality products." - Frédéric LECLERCQ (5/5), October 2025. Negative: "There were both good and bad points. First, on the good side, the staff were generally polite and friendly. On the bad side, the room was small and the sound insulation was poor, making it difficult to sleep due to noise from outside. Also, the breakfast was expensive for what it was." - ちゃぴ (1/5), October 2025.

> Positive: "Their restaurant in their Luxembourg location is fantastic. Fun (karaoke nights, great music) and great pizzas, drinks… looking forward to visiting." (Reddit, 3 months ago, referring to Luxembourg location)

The rooftop bar and views are excellent, but the location on top of a shopping center makes access less peaceful and difficult to initially find. Breakfast is average, but great options nearby.

Information gathered from one Reddit post and one Guardian article, which referenced Instagram meme accounts and member quotes. Sample size is small and not statistically representative of all Soho House members/guests.

- ⭐⭐⭐ Medium confidence, 2024-2025 data, limited public Facebook discussion. Data gathered from one Guardian article (March 2024), one Reddit thread (October 2024), and one Facebook post (June 2025). Direct public Facebook reviews for Soho House are scarce and often require login, limiting comprehensive analysis.

Room was nice and compact but had all the needed facilities. Bed was neat and very comfortable and the couch was also. Bathroom was great and we were able to come and go as we pleased but with the reception there if needed. (Reviewed: October 5, 2025); it was relatively expensive for its size, but not out of line with others.
excellent location with lots of narrow walking streets in the neighbourhood. Easy access to the metro and trams, and supermarkets were within walking distance. Like everything else in Amsterdam, it was expensive, but this small room with sufficient facilities was a good compromise for us. The room was small, the bed location (loft) ingenious and comfortable. (Reviewed: September 15, 2025)

### Key Quotes
> Positive: "Pretty good value for the discount on first stay/new openings, considering it’s just monthly rolling." (Reddit, July 2025). Positive: "My ex gf had this, and the membership paid for itself and some. We ended up staying at a new hotel opening, and managed to get 50% off the stay as she was a member (it was the Mondrian hotel in Ibiza)." (Reddit, July 2025). Negative: "When I signed up in August 2025 it was monthly rolling, but when I went to cancel month-to-month they began claiming the monthly rate is actually a yearly contract. The website now says 'Dis-loyalty is a 1-year minimum commitment'." (Reddit, September 2025). Negative: "My husband and I recently booked a hotel in Dubai, and the receptionist really pushed us to sign up for this membership. They mentioned there was a trial, so we thought, ‘Why not?’ Turns out, we unknowingly committed to a full year, and the membership can’t be canceled! LOL Just a heads-up to check what you’re agreeing to because now they just point to the terms and conditions and say there’s nothing they can do." (Reddit, March 2025).

> Positive: "On top of that, I absolutely love the Disloyalty program. It’s one of the best loyalty programs out there: I always benefit from the free drinks, great discounts, upgrades to fantastic hotels, and reduced rates. It consistently adds value to my stays and makes me feel appreciated as a customer." (Trustpilot, User: Simi Sachse, Sep 6, 2025)
Negative: "This service is essentially a scam. The app never worked properly (even costing me the free coffee benefit when it malfunctioned), booking directly through hotels was cheaper, and key terms like being locked into a year-long commitment were not clearly communicated. On top of that, they refuse to let me remove my credit card or cancel, even though the service has provided no real value. Respectfully, avoid this company at all costs and book directly with hotels instead." (Trustpilot, User: Anonymous, Oct 9, 2025)
Mixed: "My only complaint is that there isn’t a hotel in this group near me! I would love to be able to utilize the free barista-made drink each day. I would also pay attention to all of the room details, as some of the smaller rooms are **very small** and some don’t have windows. So be very mindful of the room you’re booking so you aren’t surprised!" (Blonde Voyage 901, March 18, 2025)
