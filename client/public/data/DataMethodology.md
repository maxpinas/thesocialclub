## Primary Data Source: Google Maps Reviews

### Why Google Maps?

Google Maps reviews represent the gold standard for hospitality research due to:

- **Verified purchases:** Reviews are linked to actual visits, reducing fake or incentivized feedback
- **Recency:** Fresh data from 2024-2025 reflects current market conditions
- **Volume:** Large sample sizes (800-1,200 reviews per brand) provide statistical significance
- **Consistency:** Standardized review format across all brands enables apples-to-apples comparison
- **Geographic coverage:** Reviews span multiple locations across Europe

### Data Collection Process

1. **Brand Selection:** 8 brands chosen based on competitive positioning, target audience overlap, and strategic relevance to TSH
2. **Review Extraction:** Systematic collection of reviews from Google Maps for each brand's European locations
3. **Time Period:** Reviews from January 2024 - October 2025 (21 months)
4. **Quality Control:** Removal of duplicate reviews, spam, and non-English reviews requiring translation
5. **Final Dataset:** 5,969 verified reviews across 8 brands

## Supplementary Data Source: Multi-Platform Research

### Purpose

While Google Maps provides the quantitative foundation, we supplemented with **580 reviews from 6 additional platforms** to capture qualitative depth and platform-specific insights that Google Maps may miss.

### Platforms Analyzed

1. **Reddit** (117 reviews) - Pricing debates, membership discussions, authentic opinions
2. **Booking.com** (283 reviews) - Verified stays, detailed feedback, international perspectives
3. **TripAdvisor** (80 reviews) - Comprehensive reviews, family travelers, tourism focus
4. **Instagram** (30 posts) - Design aesthetics, visual appeal, social proof
5. **TikTok** (30 videos) - Viral moments, Gen Z perspectives, visual storytelling
6. **Facebook/X** (40 posts) - Real-time feedback, community discussions

### Value of Multi-Platform Data

- **Design insights:** Instagram and TikTok reveal what drives social media engagement (e.g., Mama Shelter's Philippe Starck aesthetic)
- **Membership discussions:** Reddit provides unfiltered opinions on membership programs (e.g., CitizenM's cancellation issues, Soho House's exclusivity debate)
- **Pricing sensitivity:** Cross-platform analysis reveals willingness-to-pay and value perception
- **Niche audiences:** Platforms like TikTok capture younger demographics underrepresented on Google Maps

### Integration Approach

Supplementary data is used to:
- **Validate** Google Maps findings (e.g., "Service Quality" theme confirmed across platforms)
- **Add context** where Google Maps is thin (e.g., design mentions: n=11 on Reddit vs. minimal on Google Maps)
- **Identify gaps** in Google Maps data (e.g., membership program experiences)

**Important:** Supplementary data is clearly labeled with platform and sample size (e.g., "n=11 Reddit mentions") and never conflated with Google Maps data.

## Theme Analysis Methodology

### Theme Identification

Reviews were analyzed to identify recurring themes across 8 categories:

1. **Service Quality** - Staff friendliness, responsiveness, professionalism
2. **Room Quality & Design** - Comfort, aesthetics, furnishings, layout
3. **Amenities & Facilities** - Gym, pool, coworking, communal spaces
4. **Food & Beverage** - Restaurant quality, bar atmosphere, breakfast, value
5. **Location & Accessibility** - Proximity to attractions, transport, walkability
6. **Community & Social Atmosphere** - Events, networking, sense of belonging
7. **Cleanliness** - Room cleanliness, public space maintenance
8. **Pricing & Value** - Value for money, pricing transparency, perceived fairness

### Theme Counting

- **Positive themes:** Mentions where the theme is praised or highlighted as a strength
- **Negative themes:** Mentions where the theme is criticized or identified as a weakness
- **Example:** "The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful" → Service Quality +1 (positive)
- **Example:** "Service was slow and inattentive" → Service Quality +1 (negative)

### Statistical Significance

- **Minimum threshold:** Themes must appear in at least 10 reviews to be reported
- **Confidence levels:** Sample sizes of 800-1,200 reviews provide 95% confidence with ±3% margin of error
- **Cross-brand validation:** Themes validated across multiple brands to ensure consistency

---

## Sentiment Analysis

### Sentiment Classification

Each review is classified as:
- **Positive:** Overall favorable impression (4-5 stars on Google Maps)
- **Negative:** Overall unfavorable impression (1-2 stars on Google Maps)
- **Neutral:** Mixed or balanced feedback (3 stars on Google Maps)

### Sentiment Metrics

- **Overall sentiment:** Percentage of positive vs. negative vs. neutral reviews
- **Theme-level sentiment:** Positive vs. negative mentions for each theme
- **Net sentiment:** (Positive mentions - Negative mentions) / Total mentions

### Example: The Social Hub Sentiment

- **Overall:** 72.9% positive, 27.1% negative (n=1,000)
- **Service Quality:** 149 positive mentions, 36 negative mentions → Net sentiment: +113 (75.7% positive)

---

## Persona Validation Methodology

### Persona Development

Five target personas were identified based on theme analysis:

1. **Wellness Enthusiast** - Prioritizes amenities (gym, pool), cleanliness, room quality
2. **Business Traveler** - Prioritizes service, location, efficiency, coworking
3. **Social Traveler** - Prioritizes F&B, community, events, social atmosphere
4. **Local Professional** - Prioritizes coworking, community, convenience, local access
5. **Digital Nomad** - Prioritizes WiFi, coworking, community, long-stay value

### Signal Strength Calculation

Each persona's "signal strength" is calculated by summing theme mentions that align with that persona's priorities:

**Example: Business Traveler**
- Service Quality mentions: 1,780
- Location mentions: 890
- Coworking mentions: 320
- **Total signals:** 2,990 (29.8% of all signals)

### Competitive Positioning

For each persona, brands are ranked by signal strength:
- **TSH rank for Digital Nomad:** #1 (24.6% of all Digital Nomad signals)
- **TSH rank for Business Traveler:** #4 (14.6% of all Business Traveler signals)

This reveals where TSH is strong vs. where competitors dominate.

## Data Quality & Limitations

### Strengths

****Large sample size:** 5,969 reviews provide statistical significance
****Verified reviews:** Google Maps reviews are linked to actual visits
****Recent data:** 2024-2025 timeframe reflects current market conditions
****Cross-brand consistency:** Same methodology applied to all 8 brands
****Transparent sourcing:** All data sources clearly labeled with sample sizes

### Limitations

⚠️ **Geographic bias:** Reviews skew toward major European cities
⚠️ **Self-selection bias:** People who leave reviews may not represent all guests
⚠️ **Platform bias:** Google Maps users may differ from TripAdvisor or Booking.com users
⚠️ **Language limitation:** Non-English reviews excluded to ensure consistency
⚠️ **Temporal limitation:** Data represents 21-month snapshot, not long-term trends

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Multi-platform validation:** Supplementary data from 6 platforms reduces single-platform bias
- **Large sample sizes:** 800-1,200 reviews per brand mitigates self-selection bias
- **Cross-brand comparison:** Relative positioning (TSH vs. competitors) is more reliable than absolute metrics
- **Transparency:** All limitations clearly stated; no claims beyond what data supports

| **Consistency**           | ********** (Standardized)  | ****** (Platform-dependent)       |

### When to Use Each Source

**Use Google Maps data for:**
- Quantitative analysis (theme counts, sentiment percentages)
- Cross-brand comparisons
- Statistical significance
- Core strategic recommendations

**Use Multi-Platform data for:**
- Qualitative depth (why people feel a certain way)
- Platform-specific insights (e.g., Instagram for design appeal)
- Niche topics underrepresented on Google Maps (e.g., membership programs)
- Validation of Google Maps findings

### Example: Service Quality Analysis

**Google Maps:**
- The Social Hub: 149 positive mentions, 36 negative mentions (n=1,000)
- The Hoxton: 355 positive mentions, 45 negative mentions (n=1,200)
- **Conclusion:** The Hoxton has 2x higher service mention rate (29.6% vs. 14.9%)

**Multi-Platform (Reddit, Booking.com):**
- Confirms service gap: "The Hoxton staff remembered my name" vs. "TSH service felt impersonal"
- Adds context: TSH's student housing heritage may create service culture challenges
- **Conclusion:** Validates Google Maps finding with qualitative depth
