# Sentiment Page Redesign Strategy

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Phase:** Phase 4 - Redesign sentiment pages with percentage-based approach  
**Status:** Strategy document - ready for implementation

---

## Current Situation

**Old Sentiment Data:**
- Source: Multi-platform research (Reddit, Booking.com, etc.)
- Total records: 56 reviews
- Weak N values (n=2, n=8, etc.)
- Numbered references [1], [2], [3]
- Limited statistical significance

**Problem:** Management team cannot make strategic decisions based on n=8 sample sizes.

---

## New Approach: Google Maps Data

**New Sentiment Data:**
- Source: Google Maps reviews (verified stays)
- Total reviews: **5,969 across 8 brands**
- Robust sample sizes (200-1,200 reviews per brand)
- Percentage-based insights (72.9% positive, not n=8)
- Statistically significant
- Supplemented by multi-platform insights where they add qualitative depth

- Partner with local chefs and mixologists
- Market F&B to locals, not just guests

**Recommendation:**

### Cleanliness

**Recommendation:**

- Ensure consistency across all locations

### Pricing & Value

| Brand | Positive | Negative | Net | % of Reviews |
|-------|----------|----------|-----|--------------|

| **Conservatorium** | - | - | - | - |
| **Working From_** | - | - | - | - |

**TSH Ranking:** 4th out of 6

**Strategic Observation:** Pricing is discussed but not frequently. Low mention rates suggest pricing is generally acceptable but not seen as exceptional value.

**Recommendation:**
- Emphasize "all-inclusive" value (amenities included in price)
- Position as better value for 3+ night stays
- Transparent pricing (no hidden fees)
- Dis-Loyalty membership adds value

---

### WiFi & Connectivity

| Brand | Positive | Negative | Net | % of Reviews |

| **Conservatorium** | - | - | - | - |
| **Working From_** | - | - | - | - |

**TSH Ranking:** 1st out of 6 (tied with Zoku)

**Strategic Observation:** WiFi is adequate but not a differentiator. Low mention rates suggest it's meeting expectations but not exceeding them.

**Recommendation:**
- Guarantee WiFi speeds (100+ Mbps) for digital nomads
- Market WiFi as key feature for remote work
- Ensure consistency across all locations
- Add WiFi speed testing and monitoring

| **Conservatorium** | - | - | - | - |
| **Working From_** | - | - | - | - |

**TSH Ranking:** 2nd out of 6

**Strategic Observation:** Noise is generally well-managed. Low negative mention rates suggest soundproofing is adequate.

**Recommendation:**

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 4A: Update Sentiment Data Files

**Action:** Replace old sentiment JSON files with new Google Maps data

**Files to Update:**
- `sentiment_summary.json` - Overall sentiment across all brands
- `the_social_hub_sentiment_data.json` - TSH sentiment by theme
- `the_hoxton_sentiment_data.json` - Hoxton sentiment by theme
- `citizenm_sentiment_data.json` - CitizenM sentiment by theme
- `mama_shelter_sentiment_data.json` - Mama Shelter sentiment by theme
- `soho_house_sentiment_data.json` - Soho House sentiment by theme
- `zoku_sentiment_data.json` - Zoku sentiment by theme

- `conservatorium_hotel_sentiment_data.json` - Conservatorium sentiment by theme

**Data Source:** `/home/ubuntu/tsh-analysis/comprehensive_sentiment_data.json`

### Phase 4B: Redesign Sentiment Pages

**Current Pages:**
- `/sentiment` - Overview page with brand cards
- `/sentiment/:brandId` - Detail page for each brand

**New Design:**

**Overview Page (`/sentiment`):**
- Hero section with total reviews (5,969) and data source (Google Maps)
- Brand comparison table with sentiment percentages
- Top insights (TSH ranks 6th, gaps to close, strengths to leverage)
- Link to Data Validity Analysis page

**Detail Pages (`/sentiment/:brandId`):**
- Brand sentiment overview (% positive, negative, neutral)
- Theme-by-theme analysis with percentages
- Cross-brand comparisons (how does this brand compare?)
- Strategic insights and recommendations
- Sample quotes from reviews
- No numbered references - inline citations only

### Phase 4C: Remove Numbered References

**Action:** Remove all [1], [2], [3] style references from sentiment pages

**Replace with:**
- Inline citations (e.g., "Guests frequently mention...")
- Percentage-based insights (e.g., "72.9% of reviews are positive")
- Sample quotes with attribution (e.g., "The staff are amazing" - Amsterdam guest)

### Phase 4D: Add Cross-Brand Comparisons

**Action:** Show how each brand compares to competitors on each theme

**Example:**
- "TSH's service quality (149 positive mentions, 14.9% of reviews) ranks 6th among 8 brands. The Hoxton leads with 355 positive mentions (29.6% of reviews)."
- "TSH's community focus (81 positive mentions, 8.1% of reviews) is the highest among all brands, demonstrating the effectiveness of community programming."

### Phase 4E: Add Strategic Recommendations

**Action:** Each sentiment theme should include strategic recommendations for TSH

**Example (Service Quality):**
- **Gap:** The Hoxton's 29.6% service mention rate vs. TSH's 14.9%
- **Recommendation:** Invest in service training, benchmark against The Hoxton, empower staff
- **Target:** 20% of reviews mentioning service within 12 months
